alloc.py - Sketch of memory management, like you would do in C++.

Keep track of which arena, and ALSO the line WITHIN the arena?
So line_span becomes (int arena, int line_index, int col, int length)

Right after executing, you remove the arena from the pool.
Better names?  I think pool is the higher level, and arena is the lower level.
