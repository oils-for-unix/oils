# System tests for ul-table.
#
# Usage:
#   doctools/ul-table-test.ysh <function name>

# TODO:
#
# - another pass over ul_table doc
#
# - Run with another markdown processor other than cmark?  pandoc?
#   - Because markdown.pl doesn't support the inline HTML rule
#   - markdown-it-py - https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-py?tab=readme-ov-file
#
# - task-five needs support for proc!
#   - we might need to discover procs differently
#   - right now we're using _bash-print-funcs, which uses shopt -s extdebug,
#
# task files
# - OSH should support shopt -s extdebug!  So it can run our task files
# - always use bash, never use awk/gawk to parse compgen -F
#   - we don't need to worry about awk FS space/tab
#   - if the filename contains newlines, then we are kinda screwed, but we can 
#     detect that with bash regex I think - every line must have 3 fields
# - well I also wanted docstrings, but I think that can be an OSH/YSH-only
#   feature, not a bash feature.
#   - Oils can used for bash completion when necessary
#
# - my own bash completion needs to discover procs via the BYO protocol
#
# - Use 'byo test' - does that mean byo-server-lib also needs to be YSH?
#
# - Put all tests in CI
#   - maybe just pip install markdown-it
#
# - lazylex/html.py
#   - fix the lexer and make it data_lang/htm8.py?  
#
# - might want to run it through pyannotate too?
#   - python2/python3 conflicts with mycpp distribution though
#   - mylib.BufWriter() is different than cStringIo.StringIO aka io.StringIO
#   - see {types,asdl}/pyann_driver.py
