[Oils][] is our upgrade path from bash to a better language and runtime!  

- [OSH][] runs your existing shell scripts.
- [YSH][] is for Python and JavaScript users who avoid shell.

(The project was [slightly renamed][rename] in March 2023, so there are still
old references to "Oil".  Feel free to send pull requests with corrections!)

It's written in Python, so the code is short and easy to change.  But we
automatically translate it to C++ with custom tools, to make it fast and small.
The deployed executable doesn't depend on Python.

This README is at the root of the [git repo][git-repo].

## Contributing

* Try making the **dev build** of Oils with the instructions on the
  [Contributing][] page.  This should take 1 to 5 minutes if you have a Linux
  machine.
* If it doesn't, let us know.  You can post on the `#oil-dev` channel of
  [oilshell.zulipchat.com][], or file an issue on Github.
* Feel free to grab an [issue from
  Github](https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
  Let us know what you're thinking before you get too far.

### Quick Start on Linux

After following the instructions on the [Contributing][] page, you'll have a
Python program that you can quickly run and change!  Try it interactively:

    bash$ bin/osh

    osh$ name=world
    osh$ echo "hello $name"
    hello world

- Try running a shell script you wrote with `bin/osh myscript.sh`.
- Try [YSH][] with `bin/ysh`.

Let us know if any of these things don't work!  [The continuous
build](http://travis-ci.oilshell.org/) tests them at every commit.

### Dev Build vs. Release Build

Again, note that the **developer build** is **very different** from the release
tarball.  The [Contributing][] page describes this difference in detail.

The release tarballs are linked from the [home
page](https://www.oilshell.org/).  (Developer builds don't work on OS X, so use
the release tarballs on OS X.)

### Important: We Accept Small Contributions!

Oils is full of [many ideas](https://www.oilshell.org/blog/), which may be
intimidating at first.

But the bar to contribution is very low.  It's basically a medium size Python
program with many tests, and many programmers know how to change such programs.
It's great for prototyping.

- For OSH compatibility, I often merge **failing [spec
  tests](https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html#spec-test)**.  You don't even
  have to write code!  The tests alone help.  I search for related tests with
  `grep xtrace spec/*.test.sh`, where `xtrace` is a shell feature.
- You only have to make your code work **in Python**.  Plain Python programs
  are easy to modify.  The semi-automated translation to C++ is a separate
  step, although it often just works. 
- You can **influence the design** of [YSH][].  If you have an itch to
  scratch, be ambitious.  For example, you might want to show us how to
  implement [nonlinear pipelines](https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/issues/843).

### I aim for 24 hour response time

Please feel free to ping `andychu` on Zulip or Github if you're **waiting** for
a pull request review!  (or to ask questions)

Usually I can respond in 24 hours. I might be traveling, in which case I'll
respond with something like *I hope to look at this by Tuesday*.

I might have also **missed** your Github message, so it doesn't hurt to ping
me.

Thank you for the contributions!

### Docs

The [Wiki](https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki) has many developer docs.  Feel
free to edit them.  If you make a major change, let us know on Zulip!

There are also READMEs in some subdirectories, like `opy/` and `mycpp/`.

If you're confused, the best thing to do is to ask on Zulip and someone should
produce a pointer and/or improve the docs.

Docs for **end users** are linked from each [release
page](https://www.oilshell.org/releases.html).

## Repository Structure

Try this to show a summary of what's in the repo and their line counts:

    $ metrics/source-code.sh overview

(Other functions in this file may be useful as well.)

### A Collection of Interpreters

Oils is naturally structured as a set of mutually recursive parsers and
evaluators.  These interpreters are specified at a high-level: with regular
languages, Zephyr ASDL, and a statically-typed subset of Python.

    bin/              # Main entry points like bin/osh (source in bin/oils_for_unix.py)
    frontend/         # Input and lexing common to OSH and YSH
    osh/              # OSH parsers and evaluators (cmd, word, sh_expr)
    ysh/              # YSH parser and evaluator
    data_lang/        # Languages based on JSON
    core/             # Other code shared between OSH and YSH
    builtin/          # Builtin commands and functions
    pyext/            # Python extension modules, e.g. libc.c
    pylib/            # Borrowed from the Python standard library.
    tools/            # User-facing tools, e.g. the osh2oil translator
    display/          # User interface

### DSLs / Code Generators

Here are the tools that transform that high-level code to efficient code:

    asdl/             # ASDL implementation, derived from CPython
    pgen2/            # Parser Generator, borrowed from CPython
    mycpp/            # Experimental translator from typed Python to C++.
                      # Depends on MyPy.  See mycpp/README.md
    pea/              # Perhaps a cleaner version of mycpp
    opy/              # Python compiler in Python (mycpp/ will replace it)

### Native Code and Build System

We have native code to support both the dev build (running under CPython) and
the `oils-for-unix` build (pure C++):

    NINJA-config.sh   # Generates build.ninja

    build/            # High level build
      NINJA-steps.sh
      NINJA_main.py   # invoked by NINJA-config.sh
      NINJA_subgraph.py
      oil-defs/       # Files that define our slice of CPython.
      py.sh           # For development builds, running CPython
    cpp/              # C++ code which complements the mycpp translation
      NINJA-steps.sh
      NINJA_subgraph.py
    mycpp/            # Runtime for the translator
      NINJA-steps.sh
      NINJA_subgraph.py

    prebuilt/         # Prebuilt files committed to git, instead of in _gen/

    Python-2.7.13/    # For the slow Python build

    # Temp dirs (see below)
    _bin/
    _build/
    _gen/
    _test/

### Several Kinds of Tests

Unit tests are named `foo_test.py` and live next to `foo.py`.

    test/             # Test automation
      gold/           # Gold Test cases
      gold.sh         
      sh_spec.py      # shell spec test framework
      spec.sh         # Types of test runner: spec, unit, gold, wild
      unit.sh         
      wild.sh
    testdata/
    spec/             # Spec test cases
      bin/            # tools used in many spec tests
      testdata/       # scripts for specific test cases
      stateful/       # Tests that use pexpect

### Dev Tools and Scripts

We use a lot of automation to improve the dev process.  It's largely written in
shell, of course!

    benchmarks/       # Benchmarks should be run on multiple machines.
    metrics/          # Metrics don't change between machines (e.g. code size)
    client/           # Demonstration of OSH as a headless server.
    deps/             # Dev dependencies and Docker images
    devtools/         # For Oils developers (not end users)
      release.sh      # The (large) release process.
      services/       # talk to cloud services
    demo/             # Demonstrations of bash/shell features.  Could be
                      # moved to tests/ if automated.
      old/            # A junk drawer.
    web/              # HTML/JS/CSS for tests and tools
    soil/             # Multi-cloud continuous build (e.g. sourcehut, Github)

### Temp Dirs

Directories that begin with `_` are **not** stored in `git`.  The dev tools
above create and use these dirs.

    _bin/             # Native executables are put here
      cxx-dbg/
    _build/           # Temporary build files
    _cache/           # Dev dependency tarballs
    _devbuild/        # Generated Python code, etc.
    _gen/             # Generated C++ code that mirrors the repo
      frontend/
    _release/         # Source release tarballs are put here
      VERSION/        # Published at oilshell.org/release/$VERSION/
        benchmarks/
        doc/
        metrics/
        test/
          spec.wwz
          wild.wwz
          ...
        web/          # Static files, copy of $REPO_ROOT/web
          table/
    _test/            # Unit tests, mycpp examples
      tasks/
    _tmp/             # Output of other test suites; temp files
      spec/
      wild/
        raw/
        www/
      osh-parser/
      osh-runtime/
      vm-baseline/
      oheap/
      startup/
      ...

### Build Dependencies in `../oil_DEPS`

These tools are built from shell scripts in `soil/`.  The `oil_DEPS` dir is
"parallel" to Oils because it works better with container bind mounds.

    ../oil_DEPS/
      re2c/           # to build the lexer
      cmark/          # for building docs
      spec-bin/       # shells to run spec tests against
      mypy/           # MyPy repo
      mycpp-venv/     # MyPy binaries deps in a VirtualEnv

      py3/            # for mycpp and pea/
      cpython-full/   # for bootstrapping Oils-CPython


### Build System for End Users version.

These files make the slow "Oils Python" build, which is very different than the
**developer build** of Oils.

    Makefile
    configure
    install

These files are for the C++ `oils-for-unix` tarball (in progress):

    _build/
      oils.sh

### Doc Sources

    doc/              # A mix of docs
