[Oil][] is a new Unix shell.  It's our upgrade path from bash to a better
language and runtime!  ([Why Create a New Unix Shell?][why] / [2019 FAQ][faq])

It's written in Python, so the code is short and easy to change.  But we
automatically translate it to C++ with custom tools, to make it fast and small.
The deployed executable doesn't depend on Python.

This README is at the root of the [git repo][git-repo].

## Contributing

* Try making the **dev build** of Oil with the instructions on the
  [Contributing][] page.  This should take 1 to 5 minutes if you have a Linux
  machine.
* If it doesn't, let us know.  You can post on the `#oil-dev` channel of
  [oilshell.zulipchat.com][], or file an issue on Github.
* Feel free to grab an [issue from
  Github](https://github.com/oilshell/oil/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
  Let us know what you're thinking before you get too far.

### Quick Start on Linux

After following the instructions on the [Contributing][] page, you'll have a
Python program that you can quickly run and change!  Try it interactively:

    bash$ bin/osh

    osh$ name=world
    osh$ echo "hello $name"
    hello world

- Try running a shell script you wrote with `bin/osh myscript.sh`.
- Try the [Oil language](https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html#oil-language)
  with `bin/oil`.

Let us know if any of these things don't work!  [The continuous
build](http://travis-ci.oilshell.org/jobs/) tests them at every commit.

### Dev Build vs. Release Build

Again, note that the **developer build** is **very different** from the release
tarball.  The [Contributing][] page describes this difference in detail.

The release tarballs are linked from the [home
page](https://www.oilshell.org/).  (Developer builds don't work on OS X, so use
the release tarballs on OS X.)

### Important: We Accept Small Contributions!

Oil is full of [many ideas](https://www.oilshell.org/blog/), which may be
intimidating at first.

But the bar to contribution is very low.  It's basically a medium size Python
program with many tests, and many programmers know how to change such programs.
It's great for prototyping.

- For OSH compatibility, I often merge **failing [spec
  tests](https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html#spec-test)**.  You don't even
  have to write code!  The tests alone help.  I search for related tests with
  `grep xtrace spec/*.test.sh`, where `xtrace` is a shell feature.
- You only have to make your code work **in Python**.  Plain Python programs
  are easy to modify.  The semi-automated translation to C++ is a separate
  step, although it often just works. 
- You can **influence the design** of the Oil language.  If you have an itch to
  scratch, be ambitious.  For example, you might want to show us how to
  implement [nonlinear pipelines](https://github.com/oilshell/oil/issues/843).

### Docs

The [Wiki](https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki) has many developer docs.  Feel
free to edit them.  If you make a major change, let us know on Zulip!

There are also READMEs in some subdirectories, like `opy/` and `mycpp/`.

If you're confused, the best thing to do is to ask on Zulip and someone should
produce a pointer and/or improve the docs.

Docs for **end users** are linked from each [release
page](https://www.oilshell.org/releases.html).

## Repository Structure

Try this to show a summary of what's in the repo and their line counts:

    $ metrics/source-code.sh all

(Other functions in this file may be useful as well.)

### A Collection of Interpreters

Oil is naturally structured as a set of mutually recursive parsers and
evaluators.  These interpreters are specified at a high-level: with regular
languages, Zephyr ASDL, and a statically-typed subset of Python.

    bin/              # Main entry points like bin/osh (source in bin/oil.py)
    frontend/         # Lexing/Parsing code common to Oil and OSH
    osh/              # OSH parsers and evaluators (cmd, word, sh_expr)
    oil_lang/         # Oil parser and evaluator
    core/             # Other code shared between Oil and OSH
    pylib/            # Borrowed from the Python standard library.
    tools/            # User-facing tools, e.g. the osh2oil translator

### DSLs / Code Generators

Here are the tools that transform that high-level code to efficient code:

    asdl/             # ASDL implementation, derived from CPython
    pgen2/            # Parser Generator, borrowed from CPython
    mycpp/            # Experimental translator from typed Python to C++.
                      # Depends on MyPy.
    opy/              # Python compiler in Python (mycpp/ will replace it)
      lib/            # Common code
      compiler2/      # Bytecode compiler
      byterun/        # Metacircular bytecode VM in Python
      gold/           # tests
      byterun/        # Unused bytecode interpreter

### Native Code

We have native code to support both the dev build (running under CPython) and
the oil-native build (pure C++):

    Python-2.7.13/    # CPython is the initial basis for the Oil VM
    native/           # Python extension modules, e.g. libc.c
    cpp/              # C++ code which complements the mycpp translation

### Several Kinds of Tests

Unit tests are named `foo_test.py` and live next to `foo.py`.

    test/             # Test automation
      gold/           # Gold Test cases
      gold.sh         
      sh_spec.py      # shell spec test framework
      spec.sh         # Types of test runner: spec, unit, gold, wild
      unit.sh         
      wild.sh
    testdata/
    spec/             # Spec test cases
      bin/            # tools used in many spec tests
      testdata/       # scripts for specific test cases
      errors/         # TODO: migrate these bad shell scripts
    types/            # Scripts for running MyPy and PyAnnotate, etc.

### Dev Tools and Scripts

We use a lot of automation to improve the dev process.  It's largely written in
shell, of course!

    benchmarks/       # Benchmarks should be run on multiple machines.
    metrics/          # Metrics don't change between machines (e.g. code size)
    client/           # Demonstration of OSH as a headless server.
    build/            # Build automation
      oil-defs/       # Files that define our slice of CPython.
      dev.sh          # For development builds, running CPython
    devtools/         # For Oil developers (not end users)
      release.sh      # The (large) release process.
    demo/             # Demonstrations of bash/shell features.  Could be
                      # moved to tests/ if automated.
      old/            # A junk drawer.
    web/              # HTML/JS/CSS for tests and tools
    services/         # Integration with cloud services (e.g. Travis CI)

### Temp Dirs

Directories that begin with `_` are **not** stored in `git`.  The dev tools
above create and use these dirs.

    _bin/             # Native executables are put here
    _build/           # Temporary build files
    _devbuild/        # Developer build files not deleted upon 'make clean'
      gen/            # Generated Python and C code
    _deps/            # build dependencies like re2c
    _tmp/             # Test suites and other temp files
      spec/
      wild/
        raw/
        www/
      osh-parser/
      osh-runtime/
      vm-baseline/
      oheap/
      startup/
      ...
    _release/         # Source release tarballs are put here
      VERSION/        # Published at oilshell.org/release/$VERSION/
        benchmarks/
        doc/
        metrics/
        test/
          spec.wwz
          wild.wwz
          ...
        web/          # Static files, copy of $REPO_ROOT/web
          table/

### Build System for End Users

This is very different than the **developer build** of Oil.

    Makefile
    configure
    install

    lazylex/          # An HTML lexer which doctools/ builds upon.

## Python Files Not Translated to C++

    pylib/      # copied from Python stdlib
    core/
      py{error,os,util}.py  # too complicated to translate
    */*_def.py  # abstract definitions
