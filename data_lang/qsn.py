qsn.py: Quoted String Notation.  See doc/qsn.md.

- Slogan: "QSN Adapts Rust's String Literal Notation Express What JSON Can't."
- Rust strings with '' instead of "". Since \' and \" are allowed in Rust, this
  is OK

The QSN encoder needs to decode utf-8 in an error-tolerant fashion, as bash,
mksh, and zsh do for 'printf %q'.  GNU coreutils (ls, stat, cp) also does this
kind of decoding.

help-bash thread:
  Q: Why not make ${var@Q} the same as 'printf %q' output?
  A: It was an accident.

Comments on filename characters:

  .  and  ..  don't have to be quoted
  -  and  _   don't have to be quoted either
              but they are allowed to be
  Empty string isn't a valid filename, but we encode it as '' anyway, for
    readability
  Filenames like '+', 'a+b', ',' and 'a,b' will be quoted, although a given
  implementation could relax this.

TODO:
  - maybe_decode() in addition to decode()

TODO for other implementations:

  - Test suite.  Should it be bash, or Python 3?
  - Python 3 version
  - Pure C version using re2c.  Can this work with NUL bytes in the string?
    - would be nice: if the test suite asserted that every code path is
      covered..
    - then we could use that same test suite on other implementations
  - Would like contributions:
    - DFA-based "push" decoder
    - fun: branchless, SIMD, etc.

  Related code:

  repr() in stringobject.c in Python.  Copied to repr() in oldstl_containers.cc.
  You have to allocate 2 + 4*n bytes.  2 more bytes for the quotes.

Where does Oil Use QSN?

  maybe_shell_encode() is used in several places:

  - to display argv[i]
    - set -x / xtrace
    - 'jobs' list
    - 'getopts' error message
  - to display variable values
    - 'set'
    - declare -p
  - Exposed to the user:
    - printf %q
    - ${var@Q} (not done yet)

  TODO:
  - for QTSV:  maybe_tsv_encode()

  Note that oil still needs string_ops.ShellQuoteB() for backslash shell
  quoting, e.g. for spaces.  Not technically related to QSN.

Oil User API:

  pass s => to_qsn() => var q
  pass q => from_qsn() => var s

  to-qsn $s :q
  from-qsn $q :orig
  test $s = $orig; echo $?

Embedding within JSON strings (?)

  "'\\x00\\''"

Can be shortened to:

  "\\x00\\'"

In other words, we don't need the leading and trailing quotes.  Note that
backslashes are doubled.
