all_name_lookups.py

This program demonstrates all of the following:

  LOAD_FAST   - for optimized locals
  LOAD_NAME   - for class and module namespaces
  LOAD_ATTR   - for the . operator
                uses the descriptor protocol to look up methods!
  LOAD_GLOBAL - when the compiler knows about 'global' ?
              - and when you're at the global scope
  LOAD_CONST  - for looking up in the CodeObject

Note: LOAD_ATTR seems to be very common.
