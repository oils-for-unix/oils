lex.py -- Shell lexer.

It consists of a series of lexer modes, each with a regex -> Id mapping.

NOTE: If this changes, the lexer may need to be recompiled with
build/codegen.sh lexer.

Input Handling
--------------

Note that our style of input Handling affects the regular expressions in the
lexer.

We pass one line at a time to the Lexer, via LineLexer.  We must be able to
parse one line at a time because of interactive parsing (e.g. using the output
of GNU readline.)

There are two ways we could handle input:

  1. Every line is NUL terminated:
     'one\n\0' 'last line\0'
  2. Every line is terminated by NUL, except the last:
     'one\n' 'last line\0'

The advantage of #2 is that in the common case of reading files, we don't have
to do it one line at a time.  We could slurp the whole file in, or mmap() it,
etc.

The second option makes the regular expressions more complicated, so I'm
punting on it for now.  We assume the first.

That means:

  - No regexes below should match \0.  They are added by
    core/lexer_gen.py for re2c.

For example, [^']+ is not valid.  [^'\0]+ is correct.  Otherwise we would read
uninitialized memory past the sentinel.

Python's regex engine knows where the end of the input string is, so it
doesn't require need a sentinel like \0.

Note that re2c is not able to work in a mode with a strict length limit.  It
would cause too many extra checks?  The language is then no longer regular!

http://re2c.org/examples/example_03.html

UPDATE: Two More Options
------------------------

3. Change the \n at the end of every line to \0.  \0 becomes Id.Op_Newline, at
least in lex_mode.OUTER.

Advantage: This makes the regular expressions easier to generate, but allows
you to read in the whole file at once instead of allocating lines.

Disadvantages:
- You can't mmap() the file because the data is mutated.  Or it will have to be
  copy-on-write.
- You can't get rid of comment lines if you read the whole file.

4. Read a line at a time.  Throw away the lines, unless you're parsing a
function, which should be obvious.

After you parse the function, you can COPY all the tokens to another location.
Very few tokens need their actual text data.  Most of them can just be
identified by ID.

Contents are relevant:

- Lit_Chars, Lit_Other, Lit_EscapedChar, Lit_Digits
- Id.Lit_VarLike -- for the name, and for = vs +=
- Id.Lit_ArithVarLike
- VSub_Name, VSub_Number
- Id.Redir_* for the LHS file descriptor.  Although this is one or two bytes
  that could be copied.

You can also take this opportunity to enter the strings in an intern table.
How much memory would that save?

Remaining constructs
--------------------

Case terminators:
  ;;&                  Op_DSemiAmp  for case
  ;&                   Op_Semi

Left Index:

  _VAR_NAME_RE + '\['  Lit_LeftIndexLikeOpen
  ]=                   Lit_LeftIndexLikeClose

Indexed array and Associative array literals:
  declare -A a=([key]=value [key2]=value2)
  declare -a a=([1 + 2]=value [3 + 4]=value2)  # parsed!

  Lit_LBracket Lit_RBracketEqual
  Left_Bracket, Right_BracketEqual?
  Op_LBracket Op_RBracketEqual

# Notes on BASH_REGEX states
#
# From bash manual:
#
# - Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force the quoted portion to be
# matched as a string.
# - Bracket expressions in regular expressions must be treated carefully, since
# normal quoting characters lose their meanings between brackets.
# - If the pattern is stored in a shell variable, quoting the variable
# expansion forces the entire pattern to be matched as a string.
#
# Is there a re.escape function?  It's just like EscapeGlob and UnescapeGlob.
#
# TODO: For testing, write a script to extract and save regexes... and compile
# them with regcomp.  I've only seen constant regexes.
#
# From code: ( | ) are treated special.
