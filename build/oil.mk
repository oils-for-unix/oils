# BUG: Running 'make' the first time files because it can't find the '_build'

# NOTES:
# - _devbuild/gen/osh_help.py is a minor hack to depend on the entire
#   _devbuild/osh-quick-ref dir, since they both get generated by the same
#   build action.  (Hidden targets are known to cause problems with GNU Make.)
# - release-date.txt is in different location on purpose, so we don't show it
#   in dev mode.
# - Do we need $(OIL_SRCS) as dependencies?
