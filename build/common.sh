# - -fno-omit-frame-pointer is what Brendan Gregg says should always be on.
#   Omitting the frame pointer might be neglibly faster, but reduces
#   observability.  It's required for the 'perf' tool and other kinds of tracing.
#   Anecdotally the speed difference was in the noise on parsing
#   configure-coreutils.  
# - TODO(6/22): Disabled invalid-offsetof for now, but we should enable it after
#   progress on the garbage collector.  It could catch bugs.
