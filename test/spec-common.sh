  # - Prepend spec/bin on the front of the $PATH.  We can't isolate $PATH
  #   because we might be running in Nix, etc.
  # - Force LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 because
  #   - bash behaves differently with en_US.UTF-8, but no other shell does.
  #     (Not sure if OSH should support it, probably not.)
  #   - en_US.UTF-8 seems hard to support on Debian, even though it's the default on Debian.

  # - LOCALE_ARCHIVE is allowed to leak for Nix.
  # - OIL_GC_ON_EXIT is to pass ASAN.
  # - REPO_ROOT is to find things in spec/testdata
