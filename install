# POSIX shell script to install oils-for-unix into the proper directory.
# Distributed with the source tarball.
#
# Also shared with the old "oil.ovm" build.

# NOTE: 'install' is part of coreutils and busybox.

# The variable DESTDIR allows staged installs, where the installed files are
# not placed directly into the location they're expected to be executed from.
# They are placed in a temp dir first, which they are NOT expected to run out of.

#
# Staged installs are the default method of installation by package managers
# such as gentoo-portage.
