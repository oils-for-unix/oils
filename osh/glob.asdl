-- LST for globs.  Globs must be dynamically parsed.
--
-- NOTE: This schema is currently unused.  It would be useful for parsing
-- and translating globs to Python's regex engine, which supports non-greedy
-- matches.  But we don't want to depend on Python regexes, so we use a
-- quadratic loop like bash/mksh.  This is unfortunate, but strings are
-- generally short.
--
-- The schema could still be used for some kind of automatic glob translation.

-- RE Bracket Expression.
-- NOTE: negation is [!abc] for POSIX glob, but [^abc] for POSIX regexp!

module glob {

  glob = (glob_part* parts)

  -- Example: *.[ch] is Star, Literal('.'), CharClassExpr(False, 'ch')
  glob_part =
    Literal(string s)
  | Star    -- * is 0 or more characters, like the regex .*
  | QMark   -- ? is a single character
  | CharClassExpr(bool negated, string body)

  -- TODO:
  -- * Collating symbols are [. .]
  -- * Equivalence classes are [=
