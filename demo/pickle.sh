# Protocol ZERO
#

# The pickle VM has a stack and a memo dictionary.
#
# Oh and it also uses copy_reg and _reconstructor
# OK so what I'm missing is __new__!  I didn't know about that.
# It creates an object without initializing fields.  OK.
# Not sure I want that in OVM2.

#     if base is object:
#         obj = object.__new__(cls)
#     else:
#         obj = base.__new__(cls, state)
#         if base.__init__ != object.__init__:
#             base.__init__(obj, state)
