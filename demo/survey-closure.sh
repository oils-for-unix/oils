# The famous C# / Go issue, and the design note at the end:
#
# http://craftinginterpreters.com/closures.html
#
# "If a language has a higher-level iterator-based looping structure like
# foreach in C#, Java’s “enhanced for”, for-of in JavaScript, for-in in Dart,
# etc., then I think it’s natural to the reader to have each iteration create a
# new variable. The code looks like a new variable because the loop header
# looks like a variable declaration."
#
# I am Python-minded and I think of it as mutating the same location ...
#
# "If you dig around StackOverflow and other places, you find evidence that
# this is what users expect, because they are very surprised when they don’t
# get it."
#
# I think this depends on which languages they came from
# 
# JavaScript var vs. let is a good counterpoint ...
#
# Another solution for us is to make it explicit:
#
# captured var x = 1
#
# "The pragmatically useful answer is probably to do what JavaScript does with
# let in for loops. Make it look like mutation but actually create a new
# variable each time, because that’s what users want. It is kind of weird when
# you think about it, though."
#
# Ruby has TWO different behaviors, shown there:
#
# - for i in 1..2 - this is mutable
# - (1..2).each do |i| ... - this creates a new variable

  # I think having 'capture' be syntax sugar for value.Obj could do this:
  #
  # func f(y) {

  #   func g(self, x) capture {y, z} -> Int {

# More against closures:
#
# https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22110772
#
# "I don't understand the intuition of closures and they turn me off to
# languages immediately. They feel like a hack from someone who didn't want to
# store a copy of a parent-scope variable within a function."
#
# My question, against local scopes (var vs let in ES6) and closures vs.
# classes:
#
# https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15225193
#
# 1. Modifying collections. map(), filter(), etc. are so much clearer and more
# declarative than imperatively transforming a collection.

# 2. Callbacks for event handlers or the command pattern. (If you're using a
# framework that isn't event based, this may not come up much.)

# 3. Wrapping up a bundle of code so that you can defer it, conditionally,
# execute it, execute it in a certain context, or do stuff before and after it.
# Python's context stuff handles much of this for you, but then that's another
# language feature you have to explicitly add.

# Minority opinion about closures:
#
# - C# changed closure-in-loop
# - Go changed closure-in-loop
# - Lua changed as of 5.0?
#   - TODO: Test out closures in Lua too
#
# - Python didn't change it, but people mostly write blog posts about it, and
# don't hit it?
