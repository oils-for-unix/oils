# Not working!
#
# No gdb response received after 10 seconds.
#
# Possible reasons include:
# 1) gdbgui, gdb, or the debugged process is not running.

# 2) gdb or the inferior process is busy running and needs to be interrupted
# (press the pause button up top).

# 3) Something is just taking a long time to finish and respond back to this
# browser window, in which case you can just keep waiting.


# TODO: Try this.
#
# Rename to devtools/debugger.sh
