QTSV: An Extension to TSV 
=========================

TODO: Write this doc.

Notes: <https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/TSV2-Proposal>

- It has a required header, with optional data types (a schema).
- Each cell can contain arbitrary bytes.  They're expressed unambiguously with
  [QSN](qsn.html).

## Examples
