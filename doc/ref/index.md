Oils Reference
=============

A guide to everything in Oils (in progress).

Go back to [All Docs on Oils](../index.html) for design docs and tutorials.

## Online HTML

Oils consists of two major "modes" for shell:

- [Index of OSH Topics](index-osh.html) - Compatible
- [Index of YSH Topics](index-ysh.html) - New and Powerful

They link to **topics** within these 12 chapters:

1. [Front End](chap-front-end.html)
1. [Command Language](chap-cmd-lang.html)
1. [Word Language](chap-word-lang.html)
1. [OSH Assignment](chap-osh-assign.html)
1. [Mini Languages](chap-mini-lang.html)
1. [Builtin Commands](chap-builtin-cmd.html)
1. [Global Shell Options](chap-option.html)
1. [Special Variables](chap-special-var.html)
1. [Plugins and Hooks](chap-plugin.html)
1. [YSH Expression Language](chap-expr-lang.html)
1. [YSH Types and Methods](chap-type-method.html)
1. [Builtin Functions](chap-builtin-func.html)

The idea is that you can use OSH by itself, YSH by itself, or upgrade OSH to
YSH.

- [Index of Data Topics](index-data.html) - Oils also has data languages.

13. [J8 Notation](chap-data-lang.html)
1. Packle (TODO)

## `help` builtin command

When you type `help` in OSH or YSH, the command shows some of this material,
and prints hyperlinks to it.

## More About This Reference

### Terminology

There are 3 levels in this tree of docs, which underlies the `help` builtin:

1. *Chapter* - An HTML doc that's part of the reference.  May apply to OSH, YSH
   or both.
1. *Section* - An `<h2>` heading in a chapter
1. *Topic* - An `<h3>` heading in a chapter.  
   - It has text with a **globally unique** name like `doc-comment`.
   - May apply to OSH, YSH or both.

More terminology:

- *Table of Contents* - a doc that links to topics, within chapters.
- *Card* - Topics maybe be exported as `help` builtin "cards", either as inline
  text, or a URL to online HTML.  A card may also have a URL to POSIX or bash
  docs.

### Directory Structures

The source code is simply a tree of Markdown files:

    doc/
      release-index.md     # /release/$VERSION/

      index.md             # All Docs on Oils, /release/$VERSION/doc/
      getting-started.md
      ...

      ref/
        index.md           # this page, the Oils Reference
        index-osh.md       # link to OSH topics
        index-ysh.md       # link to YSH topics
        index-data.md

        chap-cmd-lang.md   # chapter on the command language
        ...


And the URLs basically mirror the source code:

    /release/$VERSION/
      index.html
      doc/
        index.html
        getting-started.html
        ...

        ref/
          index.html
          index-osh.html
          index-ysh.html
          index-data.html

          chap-cmd-lang.html
          ...

You can link to topics with internal anchors:

- [chap-option.html#parse_at](chap-option.html#parse_at)
- [chap-builtin-cmd.html#compgen](chap-builtin-cmd.html#compgen)
