## Usage

<h3 id="bundle-usage" class="osh-ysh-topic">App Bundle Usage</h3>

    Usage: oils-for-unix MAIN_NAME [ARG]...
           MAIN_NAME [ARG]...

oils-for-unix behaves like busybox.  If it's invoked through a symlink, e.g. 'osh',
then it behaves like that binary.  Otherwise, the binary name can be passed as
the first argument, e.g.:

    oils-for-unix osh -c 'echo hi'

<h3 id="osh-usage" class="osh-topic"><code>bin/osh</code> Usage</h3>

    Usage: osh [OPTION]... SCRIPT [ARG]...
           osh [OPTION]... -c COMMAND [ARG]...

The command line accepted by `bin/osh` is compatible with `/bin/sh` and `bash`.

    osh -c 'echo hi'
    osh myscript.sh
    echo 'echo hi' | osh

It also has a few enhancements:

    osh -n -c 'hello'                    # pretty-print the AST
    osh --ast-format text -n -c 'hello'  # print it full

osh accepts POSIX sh flags, with these additions:

  -n             parse the program but don't execute it.  Print the AST.
  --ast-format   what format the AST should be in

<h3 id="ysh-usage" class="ysh-topic"><code>bin/ysh</code> Usage</h3>

    Usage: ysh [OPTION]... SCRIPT [ARG]...
           ysh [OPTION]... -c COMMAND [ARG]...

`bin/ysh` is the same as `bin/osh` with a the `ysh:all` option group set.  So
`bin/ysh` also accepts shell flags.

    ysh -c 'echo hi'
    ysh myscript.ysh
    echo 'echo hi' | ysh


<h3 id="config" class="osh-ysh-topic">Configuring the Shell</h3>

If the --rcfile flag is specified, that file will be executed on startup.
Otherwise:

- `bin/osh` runs `~/.config/oils/oshrc`
- `bin/ysh` runs `~/.config/oils/yshrc`

Pass --rcfile /dev/null or --norc to disable the startup file.

If the --rcdir flag is specified, files in that folder will be executed on
startup.
Otherwise:

- `bin/osh` runs everything in `~/.config/oils/oshrc.d/`
- `bin/ysh` runs everything in `~/.config/oils/yshrc.d/`

Pass --norc to disable the startup directory.

History is read?

## Lexing

<h3 id="comment" class="osh-ysh-topic">Comments</h3>

A comment starts with `#` and goes until the end of the line.

    echo hi  # print a greeting

<h3 id="line-continuation" class="osh-ysh-topic">Line Continuation</h3>

A backslash `\` at the end of a line continues the line without executing it:

    ls /usr/bin \
       /usr/lib \
       ~/src        # A single command split over three lines

<h3 id="doc-comment" class="ysh-topic">Doc Comments</h3>

Doc comments look like this:

    proc deploy {   
      ### Deploy the app
      echo hi
    }

<h3 id="multiline-command" class="ysh-topic">Multi-Line Command</h3>

The ... prefix starts a single command over multiple lines.  It allows writing
long commands without \ continuation lines, and the resulting limitations on
where you can put comments.

Single command example:

    ... chromium-browser
        # comment on its own line
        --no-proxy-server
        --incognito  # comment to the right
        ;

Long pipelines and and-or chains:

    ... find .
        # exclude tests
      | grep -v '_test.py'
      | xargs wc -l
      | sort -n
      ;

    ... ls /
     && ls /bin
     && ls /lib
     || error "oops"
     ;
