[Oils Reference](index.html) &mdash; Chapter **Types and Methods**

</div>

This chapter describes YSH types and methods.  There are also two OSH types for
bash compatibility.

<span class="in-progress">(in progress)</span>

<div id="dense-toc">
</div>

## OSH

These two types are for OSH code only.

### BashArray

A bash array holds a sequence of strings.  Some entries may be **unset** (not
an empty string).

See [sh-init-list][] and [sh-array][] for creation/mutation of BashArray.
In YSH, prefer to use [List](#List) instances.

[sh-array]: chap-osh-assign.html#sh-array
[sh-init-list]: chap-osh-assign.html#sh-init-list

### BashAssoc

A bash associative array is a mapping from strings to strings.

See [sh-init-list][] and [sh-assoc][] for creation/mutation of BashAssoc.  In
YSH, prefer to use [Dict](#Dict) instances.

[sh-assoc]: chap-osh-assign.html#sh-assoc

## Atoms

<!-- TODO:
true and false should be SINGLETONS
null is already a singleton
-->

### Null

An `Obj` instance representing the `Null` type.

The `Null` type has a single value spelled `null`.  (Related:
[atom-literal][]).

[atom-literal]: chap-expr-lang.html#atom-literal

### null

A value that's not equal to any other.  Values that aren't explicitly
initialized are `null`, e.g.

    var x
    = x  # => (Null)   null

Its type is `Null`.

### Bool

An `Obj` instance representing the boolean type.

This type has 2 values: `true` and `false`.  (Related: [atom-literal][]).

### expr/true

A single value representing truth, e.g.

    = 42 === 42  # => true

### expr/false

A single value representing the opposite of truth, e.g.

    = 42 === 3  # => false

## Numbers

### Int

Integers are currently 64-bit signed integers (on all platforms).  TODO: they
should be arbitrary precision.

There are many way of writing integers; see [int-literal][].

In shell, ASCII strings like `'42'` are often used for calculations on
integers.  But you can use a "real" integer type in YSH.

[int-literal]: chap-expr-lang.html#int-literal


### Float

YSH has 64-bit floating point numbers.  See [float-literal][] for how to denote
them.

[float-literal]: chap-expr-lang.html#float-literal

### Range
  
A `Range` is a pair of two numbers, used for iteration.  See [range][] for how
to denote them.

Ranges are used for iteration; see [ysh-for][].

[range]: chap-expr-lang.html#range
[ysh-for]: chap-cmd-lang.html#ysh-for

## String

In Oils, strings may contains any sequence of bytes, which may be UTF-8
encoded.

Internal NUL bytes (`0x00`) are allowed.

When passing such strings to say the [cd][] builtin, the string will be
truncated before the NUL.  This is because most C functions like `chdir()` take
NUL-terminated strings.

[cd]: chap-builtin-cmd.html#cd

### Str

An `Obj` instance representing the string type.  Let's use this definition:

    var mystr = 'mystr'

### find()

TODO:

```raw
var i = mystr.find('y')
```

This is similar to

```raw
= mystr.contains('y')
```

Both of them do substring search.  Also similar to `mystr.search(/ 'y' /)`.

<!-- Note: Python also has start, end indices, to reduce allocations -->

### replace()

Replace substrings with a given string.

    = mystr.replace('OSH', 'YSH')

Or replace an Eggex with a string or function.

    = mystr.replace(/ d+ /, "<redacted>")  # => "code is <redacted>"

Refer to Eggex captures with replacement expressions. Captured values can be
referenced with `$1`, `$2`, etc.

    var mystr = '1989-06-08'
    var pat = / <capture d{4}> '-' <capture d{2}> '-' <capture d{2}> /
    = mystr.replace(pat, ^"Year: $1, Month: $2, Day: $3")

Captures can also be named.

    = mystr.replace(/ <capture digit{4} as year : int> /, ^"$[year + 1]")

`$0` refers to the entire capture itself in a substitution string.

    var mystr = "replace with mystr.replace()"
    = mystr.replace(/ alpha+ '.' alpha+ '()' /, ^"<code>$0</code>")
    # => "replace with <code>mystr.replace()</code>"

In addition to captures, other variables can be referenced within a replacement
expression.

    var myvar = 'zz'
    = mystr.replace(/ <capture alpha+> /, ^"$1 and $myvar")

To limit the number of replacements, pass in a named count argument. By default
the count is `-1`. For any count in [0, `MAX_INT`], there will be at most count
replacements. Any negative count means "replace all" (i.e. `count=-2` behaves
exactly like `count=-1`).

    var mystr = "bob has a friend named bob"
    = mystr.replace("bob", "Bob", count=1)   # => "Bob has a friend named bob"
    = mystr.replace("bob", "Bob", count=-1)  # => "Bob has a friend named Bob"

The following matrix of signatures are supported by `replace()`:

```raw
= mystr.replace(string_val, subst_str)
= mystr.replace(string_val, subst_expr)
= mystr.replace(eggex_val, subst_str)
= mystr.replace(eggex_val, subst_expr)
```

Replacing by an `Eggex` has some limitations:

- If a `search()` results in an empty string match, eg.
  `'abc'.split(/ space* /)`, then we raise an error to avoid an infinite loop.
- The string to replace on cannot contain NUL bytes because we use the libc
  regex engine.

### startsWith()

Checks if a string starts with a pattern, returning true if it does or false if
it does not.

    = b'YSH123'.startsWith(b'YSH')  # => true
    = b'123YSH'.startsWith(b'YSH')  # => false
    = b'123YSH'.startsWith(/ d+ /)  # => true
    = b'YSH123'.startsWith(/ d+ /)  # => false

Matching is done based on bytes, not runes.

    = b'\yce\ya3'                 # => (Str)   "Σ"
    = 'Σ'.startsWith(b'\yce')     # => true
    = 'Σ'.endsWith(b'\ya3')       # => true

### endsWith()

Like `startsWith()` but returns true if the _end_ of the string matches.

    = b'123YSH'.endsWith('YSH')   # => true
    = b'YSH123'.endsWith(/ d+ /)  # => true

### trim()

Removes text from the start and end of a `Str`.

To specify what to remove, pass either a `Str` argument:

    = 'xxxYSHxxx'.trim('xxx')      # => 'YSH'
    = 'xxxYSH   '.trim('xxx')      # => 'YSH   '
    = '   YSHxxx'.trim('xxx')      # => '   YSH'
    = '   YSH   '.trim('xxx')      # => '   YSH   '

Or an `Eggex` argument:

    = '123YSH456'.trim(/ d+ /)     # => 'YSH'

If no arguments are passed, whitespace is removed:

    = b' YSH\n'.trim()             # => 'YSH'

These code points are considered whitespace:

- `U+0009` - Horizontal tab `\t`
- `U+000A` - Newline `\n`
- `U+000B` - Vertical tab `\u{b}`
- `U+000C` - Form feed `\f`
- `U+000D` - Carriage return `\r`
- `U+0020` - Normal space `' '`
- `U+00A0` - No-break space (NBSP) `\u{a0}`
- `U+FEFF` - Zero-width no-break space (ZWNBSP) `\u{feff}`

To obtain code points, Oils decodes the string as UTF-8.  Bytes that are not
valid UTF-8 cause a fatal error.

Other code points are considered whitespace in the Unicode standard, but we use
only the ones above, so that these methods have a stable specification.

---

Note that Eggex patterns compile to POSIX extended regular expressions (ERE),
which have a different notion of whitespace:

- `/blank/` - matches `\t`, normal space
- `/space/` - matches `\t \n`, vertical tab, `\f \r`, normal space, and
  possibly Unicode separators `\p{Z}`

<!-- TODO: link to a section on POSIX ERE and Unicode -->

### trimStart()

Like `trim()` but only removes characters from the _start_ of the string.

    = b' YSH\n'   .trimStart()        # => b'YSH\n'
    = b'xxxYSHxxx'.trimStart('xxx')   # =>  'YSHxxx'
    = b'123YSH456'.trimStart(/ d+ /)  # =>  'YSH456'

### trimEnd()

Like `trim()` but only removes characters from the _end_ of the string.

    = b' YSH\n'   .trimEnd()          # => ' YSH'
    = b'xxxYSHxxx'.trimEnd('xxx')     # => 'xxxYSH'
    = b'123YSH456'.trimEnd(/ d+ /)    # => '123YSH'

### upper()

Respects unicode.

### lower()

Respects unicode.

### search()

Search for a regex in the string.  Return a [Match](#Match) value for the first
occurrence, or `null` if no match is found.

    var m = 'hi world'.search(/[a e i o u]/)  # search for vowels
    = m.start(0)  # => index 1, matching 'i'

    var m = 'hi world'.search(/'foo'/)
    = m           # => null

The `pos` parameter lets you start searching in the middle of the string:

    var m = 'hi world'.search(/[a e i o u]/, pos=3)
    = m.start(0)  # => index 4, matching 'o'

    var m = 'hi world'.search(/[a e i o u]/, pos=5)
    = m           # => null, no more matches

Notes:

- `%start` aka `^` will match only when `pos === 0`.
- This method behaves like Python's `re.search()`.

### leftMatch()

Test whether the regex matches the string at the given `pos`, which is `0` by
default.  That is, it does **not** look ahead for matches, unlike the
`search()` method.

Returns a [Match](#Match) value, or `null` if it doesn't match.


    var m = 'ale'.leftMatch(/[a e i o u]/)
    = m.start(0)  # => index 0 for 'a'

    var m = 'hi world'.leftMatch(/[a e i o u]/)
    = m           # => null, because 'h' is not a vowel

The `pos` parameter lets you match in the middle of the string:

    var m = 'hi world'.leftMatch(/[a e i o u]/, pos=1)
    = m.start(0)  # => index 1, matching 'i'

    var m = 'hi world'.leftMatch(/[a e i o u]/, pos=3)
    = m           # null, because 'w' is not a vowel

`leftMatch()` and `pos` can be used to implement iterative lexers.  See [YSH
Regex API](../ysh-regex-api.html).

Notes:

- The difference between `leftMatch()` and `search()` is like Python's
  `re.match()` versus `re.search()`.
- Unlike `search()`, `%start` aka `^` may match when `pos !== 0`.
  - This is a quirk compared to Python: under the hood, `leftMatch()` is
    implemented with `^`.
- The eggex flag `reg_newline` (libc `REG_NEWLINE`) affects the meaning of `^`.
  Generally speaking, avoid using `leftMatch()` with patterns with
  `reg_newline` set.

### split()

Split a string by a `Str` separator `sep` into a `List` of chunks.

    pp ('a;b;;c'.split(';'))       # => ["a", "b", "", "c"]
    pp ('a<>b<>c<d'.split('<>'))   # => ["a", "b", "c<d"]
    pp ('🌞🌝🌞🌝🌞'.split('🌝'))  # => ["🌞", "🌞", "🌞"]

Or split using an `Eggex`.

    pp ('a b  cd'.split(/ space+ /))   # => ["a", "b", "cd"]
    pp ('a,b;c'.split(/ ',' | ';' /))  # => ["a", "b", "c"]

Optionally, provide a `count` to split on `sep` at most `count` times. A
negative `count` will split on all occurrences of `sep`.

    pp ('a;b;;c'.split(';', count=2))   # => ["a", "b", ";c"]
    pp ('a;b;;c'.split(';', count=-1))  # => ["a", "b", "", "c"]

Passing an empty `sep` will result in an error.

```raw
pp ('abc'.split(''))  # => Error: Sep cannot be ""
```

Splitting by an `Eggex` has some limitations:

- If a `search()` results in an empty string match, eg.
  `'abc'.split(/ space* /)`, then we raise an error to avoid an infinite loop.
- The string to split cannot contain NUL bytes because we use the libc regex
  engine.

### lines()

Split a string into lines N lines, where N is the number of newlines.

    var s = u'foo\nbar\n'  # 2 lines
    = s.lines()            # => ['foo', 'bar']

Notice that the result has 2 lines, where as `s.split('\n')` would have 3.

---

Pass `eol=` to override the default delimiter of `\n`:

    var s = b'foo\y00bar\y00'  # 2 lines terminated by NUL
    = s.lines(eol=\y00)        # => ['foo', 'bar']

(This is useful for the output of `find . -print0`.)

Notes:

- Use `read --all` and `_reply.lines()` to replace the bash builtin
  [readarray][] aka [mapfile][].
- There is no special handling of carriage returns (`\r`), although you can
  pass `eol=u'\r\n'`.

[readarray]: chap-builtin-cmd.html#readarray
[mapfile]: chap-builtin-cmd.html#mapfile

## Patterns

### Eggex

An `Eggex` is a composable regular expression.  It can be spliced into other
regular expressions.

### Match

A `Match` is the result searching for an `Eggex` within a `Str`.

### group()

Returns the string that matched a regex capture group.  Group 0 is the entire
match.

    var m = '10:59'.search(/ ':' <capture d+> /)
    echo $[m.group(0)]  # => ':59'
    echo $[m.group(1)]  # => '59'

Matches can be named with `as NAME`:

    var m = '10:59'.search(/ ':' <capture d+ as minute> /)

And then accessed by the same name:

    echo $[m.group('minute')]  # => '59'

### start()

Like `group()`, but returns the **start** position of a regex capture group,
rather than its value.

    var m = '10:59'.search(/ ':' <capture d+ as minute> /)
    echo $[m.start(0)]         # => position 2 for ':59'
    echo $[m.start(1)]         # => position 3 for '59'

    echo $[m.start('minute')]  # => position 3 for '59'

### end()

Like `group()`, but returns the **end** position of a regex capture group,
rather than its value.

    var m = '10:59'.search(/ ':' <capture d+ as minute> /)
    echo $[m.end(0)]         # => position 5 for ':59'
    echo $[m.end(1)]         # => position 5 for '59'

    echo $[m.end('minute')]  # => 5 for '59'


## Containers

### List

An `Obj` instance representing the `List` type.

A List contains an ordered sequence of values.

### List/append()

Add an element to a list.

    var fruits = :|apple banana pear|
    call fruits->append('orange')
    echo @fruits  # => apple banana pear orange

Similar names: [append][]

[append]: chap-index.html#append

### pop()

remove an element from a list and return it.

    var fruits = :|apple banana pear orange|
    var last = fruits->pop()  # 'orange' is removed AND returned
    echo $last                # => orange
    echo @fruits              # => apple banana pear

### extend()

Extend an existing list with the elements of another list.

    var foods = :|cheese chocolate|
    var fruits = :|apple banana|
    call foods->extend(fruits)
    echo @foods  # => cheese chocolate apple banana

### indexOf()

Returns the first index of the element in the list, or -1 if it's not present.

    var names = :| Jane Peter Joana Sam |
    echo $[names.indexOf('Sam')]    # => 3
    echo $[names.indexOf('Simon')]  # => -1

### insert()

Insert an element into the list at the given index.

    var hills = :| pillar glaramara helvellyn |
    call hills->insert(1, 'raise')
    echo @hills  # => pillar raise glaramara helvellyn

- If you pass an index greater than the list length, the item will be inserted
  at the end.
- If you pass a negative index, it's interpreted as relative to the end of the
  list, like slicing.
  - If the negative index is out of bounds, the item will be inserted at the
    beginning of the list.

### lastIndexOf()

Returns the index of the last occurring instance of the specified
element in the list, or -1 if it's not present.

    var names = :| Sam Alice Sam Sam |
    echo $[names.lastIndexOf('Sam')]    # => 3
    echo $[names.lastIndexOf('Simon')]  # => -1

### remove()

Remove the first instance of the specified element from the list, if it exists.
Returns `null`, even if the element did not exist.

    var lakes = :| coniston derwent wast |
    call lakes->remove('wast')
    echo @lakes  # => coniston derwent

### reverse()

Reverses a list in place.

    var fruits = :|apple banana pear|
    call fruits->reverse()
    echo @fruits  # => pear banana apple

### List/clear()

Remove all entries from the List:

    var fruits = :|apple banana pear|
    call fruits->clear()
    echo $[len(fruits)]  # => 0

### Dict

An `Obj` instance representing the `Dict` type.

A Dict contains an ordered sequence of key-value pairs.  Given the key, the
value can be retrieved efficiently.

Let's use this definition:

    var mydict = {}

### erase()

Ensures that the given key does not exist in the dictionary.

    var book = {
      title: 'The Histories',
      author: 'Herodotus',
    }
    = book
    # => (Dict)   {title: 'The Histories', author: 'Herodotus'}

    call book->erase('author')
    = book
    # => (Dict)   {title: 'The Histories'}

    # repeating the erase call does not cause an error
    call book->erase('author')
    = book
    # => (Dict)   {title: 'The Histories'}

### accum()

TODO:

```raw
call mydict->accum('key', 'string to append')
```

Similar:

```raw
setvar mydict['k'] += 3  # TODO: default value of 0
```

### Dict/clear()

TODO:

Remove all entries from the Dict:

```raw
call mydict->clear()
```

### Place

### setValue()

A Place is used as an "out param" by calling setValue():

    proc p (; out) {
      call out->setValue('hi')
    }

    var x
    p (&x)
    echo x=$x  # => x=hi

## Code Types

### Func

The type of a user-defined function.

A Func captures the stack frame it was defined in, making it a closure.  It
also captures the frame of the module it was defined in.

### BuiltinFunc

A func that's part of Oils, like `len()`.

### BoundFunc

The [thin-arrow][] creates a bound func:

    var bound2 = [] -> append

[thin-arrow]: chap-expr-lang.html#thin-arrow
[fat-arrow]: chap-expr-lang.html#thin-arrow

### Proc

The type of a user-defined proc &mdash; i.e. a "procedure" or "process".

A Proc captures the stack frame it was defined in, making it a closure.  It
also captures the frame of the module it was defined in.

### docComment()

Returns the [doc comment][doc-comment] associated with this proc or shell
function.

If there's no comment, it returns `null`.

[doc-comment]: chap-front-end.html#doc-comment

### BuiltinProc

A builtin proc, aka builtin command, like `module-invoke`.

## Objects

### Obj

An instance of `Obj`, representing the `Obj` type.

TODO: make it callable.

### `__invoke__`

<!-- copied from doc/proc-func-md -->

The `__invoke__` meta-method makes an Object "proc-like".

First, define a proc, with the first typed arg named `self`:

    proc myInvoke (word_param; self, int_param) {
      echo "sum = $[self.x + self.y + int_param]"
    }

Make it the `__invoke__` method of an `Obj`:

    var methods = Object(null, {__invoke__: myInvoke})
    var invokable_obj = Object(methods, {x: 1, y: 2})

Then invoke it like a proc:

    invokable_obj myword (3)
    # sum => 6

### new

Create an object:

    func mymethod(self) { 
      return (42)
    }
    var methods = Obj.new({methodName: mymethod}, null)
    var instance = Obj.new({x: 3, y: 4}, methods)

TODO: This will become `Obj.__call__`, which means it's written `Obj`.

### `__call__`

TODO

### `__index__`

The `__index__` meta-method controls what happens when `obj[x]` is evaluated.

It's currently used for type objects:

    var t = Dict[Str, Int]
    assert [t is Dict[Str, Int]]  # always evaluates to the same instance

### `__str__`

TODO

## Reflection

Definitions used below:

    proc my-cd (dest; ; ; block) {
      pushd $dest
      call io->eval(block, in_captured_frame=true)
      popd
    }
    proc my-where (; predicate) {
      for line in (io.stdin) {
        # dummy implementation that doesn't use predicate
        write -- $line
      }
    }

### Command

A value of type `Command` represents an unevaluated command.  There are **two**
syntaxes for such values:

1. In [expression mode][command-vs-expression-mode], a [block
   expression][block-expr] looks like this:

       var block = ^(echo $PWD; ls *.txt)

   This is similar to `$(echo $PWD)` in shell.

2. In [command mode][command-vs-expression-mode], a YSH [block-arg][] is 
   also of type `Command`:

       my-cd /tmp { 
         echo $PWD
       }

   This is similar to `{ echo $PWD; }` in shell ([sh-block][])

[brace-group]: chap-cmd-lang.html#sh-block

---

The `Command` value is bound to a stack frame.  This frame will be pushed as an
"enclosed frame" when the command is evaluated.

[block-expr]: chap-expr-lang.html#block-expr
[block-arg]: chap-cmd-lang.html#block-arg

[command-vs-expression-mode]: ../command-vs-expression-mode.html

### sourceCode

The `Command.sourceCode()` method returns a `Dict` with the source code and
location info for a literal block.

    # define a proc
    proc p ( ; ; ; block) {
      = block.sourceCode()
    }

    # call it with a literal block, getting the source code
    p { echo hi }  # => { location_str:        "[stdin]",
                   #      location_start_line: 1,
                   #      code_str:            "echo hi\n" }

The `location_str` and `location_start_line` fields can be passed back into the
YSH interpreter, so that error messages blame the original location, not new
locations from `code_str`:

```raw 
... ysh 
    --location-str        $[src.location_str]
    --location-start-line $[src.location_start_line]
    file_with_code_str.ysh
    ;
```

Currently, you can't extract the source code of an `Command` expression.  The
method returns `null`:

    var cmd = ^(echo hi)
    = cmd.sourceCode()  # => null

Related topic: [shell-flags][] documents the `--location-str` and
`--location-start-line` flags.

[shell-flags]: chap-front-end.html#shell-flags

### Expr

A value of type `Expr` represents an unevaluated expression.  There are **three**
syntaxes for such values:

1. In [expression mode][command-vs-expression-mode], an
   [expression literal][expr-literal] looks like this:

       var expr = ^[42 + a[i]]

1. There's also a shortcut for string literals:

       var s = "foo".replace('o', ^"-$0-")
       echo $s  # => f-o--o-

   The syntax `^"-$0-"` is short for `^["-$0-"]`.  You can omit the brackets.

1. In [command mode][command-vs-expression-mode], a YSH [lazy-expr-arg][] is
   also of type `Expr`:

       ls | my-where [size > 42]

   This is a shortcut for:

       ls | my-where (^[size > 42])  # same as syntax 1

[lazy-expr-arg]: chap-cmd-lang.html#lazy-expr-arg

---

The `Expr` value is bound to a stack frame.  This frame will be pushed as an
"enclosed frame" when the expression is evaluated.

[expr-literal]: chap-expr-lang.html#expr-lit

### Frame

A value that represents a stack frame.

You can turn it into a Dict with `dict(myframe)`.

### DebugFrame

An opaque value returned by [vm.getDebugStack()][], which has a `toString()`
method.

[vm.getDebugStack()]: chap-type-method.html#getDebugStack

Logically, it represents one of:

1. An invocation of a proc or shell function 
1. A YSH func call
1. The OSH [source][] builtin
1. The YSH [use][] builtin

[source]: chap-builtin-cmd.html#source
[use]: chap-builtin-cmd.html#use

### toString()

Return a string representing the `DebugFrame` value.

We recommend that you print each frame with a numeric prefix, like this:

<!-- bug: highlighting finds # within "" -->

```none
proc print-stack {
  for i, frame in (vm.getDebugStack()) {
    write --end '' -- "  #$[i+1] $[frame.toString()]"
  }
}
```

Then the output will look like:

```none
  #1 main.ysh
    source lib.ysh
    ^~~~~~
  #2 lib.ysh
    print-stack
    ^~~~~~~~~~~
``` 

### io

### stdin

Returns the singleton `stdin` value, which you can iterate over:

    seq 3 | for line in (io.stdin) {
       echo "+$line"
    }
    # =>
    # +1
    # +2
    # +3

This is buffered line-based I/O, as opposed to the unbuffered I/O of the [read][]
builtin.

[read]: chap-builtin-cmd.html#read

### io/eval()

Given a `Command` value (e.g. a block argument), execute it, and return `null`.

    var cmd = ^(echo hi)
    call io->eval(cmd)  # => hi

This method is more principled and flexible than shell's [eval][] builtin.
It's especially useful in pure functions.

[eval]: chap-builtin-cmd.html#cmd/eval

It accepts optional args that let you control name binding:

- `dollar0` for `$0`
- `pos_args` for `$1 $2 $3`
- `vars` for named variables

Example:

    var cmd = ^(echo "zero $0, one $1, named $x")
    call io->eval(cmd, dollar0="z", pos_args=['one'], vars={x: "x"})
    # => zero z, one one, named x

Scoping rules:

- The frame that contains the `Command`, e.g.  `^(echo hi)` or `p { echo hi }`,
  is called the *captured* frame.
- Normally, a `Command` is evaluated in a new stack frame, which "encloses" the
  captured frame.  That is, a `Command` is a *closure*.

The `in_captured_frame` argument changes this behavior:

    call io->eval(cmd, pos_args=['one'], in_captured_frame=true)

In this case, the captured frame becomes the local frame.  It's useful for
creating procs that behave like builtins:

    my-cd /tmp {           # my-cd is a proc, which pushes a new stack frame
      var listing = $(ls)  # This variable is created in the captured frame
    }
    echo $listing          # It's still visible after the proc returns

---

To evaluate "purely", use the [`eval()`][func/eval] function.

[func/eval]: chap-builtin-func.html#func/eval

### io/evalToDict()

Returns a `Dict` corresponding to the stack frame that the `Command` is
evaluated in.

Example:

    var x = 10  # captured
    var cmd = ^(var a = 42; var hidden_ = 'h'; var b = x + 1; )

    var d = io->eval(cmd, to_dict=true)

    pp (d)  # => {a: 42, b: 11}

Names that end with an underscore `_` are not copied, so `hidden_` is not in
the `Dict`.

### io/evalExpr()

Given an `Expr` value, evaluate it and return its value:

    var i = 42
    var expr = ^[i + 1] 

    = io->evalExpr(expr)  # => 43

It accepts optional args that let you control name binding:

- `pos_args` for `$1 $2 $3`
- `dollar0` for `$0`
- `vars` for named variables

Example:

    var expr = ^["zero $0, one $1, named $x"]
    var s = io->evalExpr(expr, dollar0="z", pos_args=['one'], vars={x: "x"})
    echo $s  # => zero z, one one, named x

Note that these expressions that have effects:

- `^[ myplace->setValue(42) ]` - memory operation
- `^[ $(echo 42 > hi) ]` - I/O operation

---

To evaluate "purely", use the [`evalExpr()`][func/evalExpr] function.

[func/evalExpr]: chap-builtin-func.html#func/evalExpr

### captureStdout()

Run a Command, and return its stdout as a astring.

    var c = ^(echo hi)
    var stdout_str = io.captureStdout(c)  # => "hi"

It's like `$()` [command subs][command-sub], but can be used in pure functions
that have access to `io`.

[command-sub]: chap-word-lang.html#command-sub

`NUL` bytes and any trailing newline `\n` is removed,

If the command fails, `captureStdout()` raises an error, which can be caught
with `try`.

    try {
      var s = io.captureStdout(c)
    }

### captureAll()

Run a Command, and return its `stdout` string, `stderr` string, and integer
`status`.

    var c = ^(echo out; echo err >&2)
    var r = io.captureAll(c)  # => {stdout: b'out\n', stderr: b'err\n', status: 0}

It's similar to `io.captureStdout`, but returns more info.

- NUL bytes and trailing newlines `\n` are **not** removed.
- Because it captures the status, it doesn't fail when the status is non-zero.

    = io.captureAll(^(echo stdout; echo stderr >&2; exit 3))
    (Dict)
    {
        stdout: 'stdout\n',
        stderr: 'stderr\n',
        status: 3
    }

### promptVal()

An API the wraps the `$PS1` language.  For example, to simulate `PS1='\w\$ '`:

    func renderPrompt(io) {
      var parts = []
      call parts->append(io.promptVal('w'))  # pass 'w' for \w
      call parts->append(io.promptVal('$'))  # pass '$' for \$
      call parts->append(' ')
      return (join(parts))
    }

### time()

TODO: Depends on system clock.

### strftime()

TODO: Like the awk function, this takes an timestamp directly.

In other words, it calls C localtime() (which depends on the time zone
database), and then C strftime().

### glob()

TODO: The free function glob() actually does I/O.  Although maybe it doesn't
fail?

### vm

An object with functions for introspecting the Oils VM.

### getFrame()

Given an index, get a handle to a call stack frame.

    proc p {
      var frame
      setvar frame = vm.getFrame(0)   # global frame
      setvar frame = vm.getFrame(1)   # first frame pushed on the global frame

      setvar frame = vm.getFrame(-1)  # the current frame, aka local frame
      setvar frame = vm.getFrame(-2)  # the calling frame
    }
    p

If the index is out of range, an error is raised.

### getDebugStack()

Returns a list of [DebugFrame][] values, representing the current call stack.

[DebugFrame]: #DebugFrame

### id()

Returns an integer ID for mutable values like List, Dict, and Obj.

    = vm.id({})  # => (Int)  123

You can use it to test if two names refer to the same instance.

`vm.id()` is undefined on immutable values like Bool, Int, Float, Str, etc.
