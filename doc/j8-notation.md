J8 Notation - Fixing the JSON-Unix Mismatch
===========

J8 Notation is a set of text interchange formats.  It's a syntax for:

1. **strings** / bytes
1. tree-shaped **records** (like [JSON]($xref))
1. line-based **streams** (like Unix)
1. **tables** (like TSV)

It's part of the Oils project, and is intended to solve the *JSON-Unix
Mismatch*: the Unix kernel deals with bytes, while JSON deals with Unicode
strings (plus UTF-16 errors).

It's backward compatible with [JSON]($xref), and built on top of
it.

But just like JSON isn't only for JavaScript, J8 Notation isn't only for Oils.
Any language understands JSON should also understand J8 Notation.

(Note: J8 replaced the similar [QSN](qsn.html) design in January
2024.  QSN wasn't as compatible with both JSON and YSH code.)

## Quick Picture

<style>
  .uni4 {
    /* color: #111; */
  }
  .dq {
    color: darkred;
  }
  .sq {
    color: #111;
  }
</style>

There are 3 styles of J8 strings:

<pre style="font-size: x-large;">
 <span class=dq>"</span>hi &#x1f642; \u<span class=uni4>D83D</span>\u<span class=uni4>DE42</span><span class=dq>"</span>      <span class="sh-comment"># JSON-style, with surrogate pair</span>

<span class=sq>b'</span>hi &#x1f642; \yF0\y9F\y99\y82<span class=sq>'</span>  <span class="sh-comment"># Can be ANY bytes, including UTF-8</span>

<span class=sq>u'</span>hi &#x1f642; \u{1F642}<span class=sq>'</span>         <span class="sh-comment"># nice alternative syntax</span>
</pre>

They all denote the same decoded string &mdash; "hi" and two `U+1F642` smiley
faces:

<pre style="font-size: x-large;">
hi &#x1f642; &#x1f642;
</pre>

Why did we add these `u''` and `b''` strings?

- We want to represent any string that a Unix kernel can emit (`argv` arrays,
  env variables, filenames, file contents, etc.)
  - J8 encoders emit `b''` strings to avoid losing information.  
- `u''` strings are like `b''` strings, but they can only express valid
  Unicode strings.  

<!-- They can't express arbitrary binary data, and there's no such thing as a
surrogate pair or half. -->

---

Now, starting with J8 strings, we define the formats JSON8:

    { name: "Alice",
      signature: b'\y01 ... \yff',  // binary data
    }

J8 Lines:

      doc/hello.md
     "doc/with spaces.md"
    b'doc/with byte \yff.md'

and TSV8:

    !tsv8   size    name
    !type   Int     Str
            42        doc/hello.md
            55       "doc/with spaces.md"
            99      b'doc/with byte \yff.md'

Together, these are called *J8 Notation*.

(JSON8 and TSV8 are still to be fully implemented in Oils.).

## Goals

1. Fix the **JSON-Unix mismatch**: all text formats should be able to express
   byte strings.
   - But it's OK to use plain JSON in Oils, e.g. when filenames are known to be
     strings.
1. Provide an option to avoid the surrogate pair / **UTF-16 legacy** of JSON.
1. Allow expressing metadata about **strings vs. bytes**.
1. Turn TSV into an **exterior** [data
   frame](https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/11/30.html) format.
   - Unix tools like `awk`, `cut`, and `sort` already understand tables
     informally.

<!--
   - TSV8 cells can represent arbitrary binary data, including tabs and
     newlines.
-->

Non-goals:

1. "Replace" JSON.  JSON8 is backward compatible with JSON, and sometimes the
   lossy encoding is OK.
1. Resolve the strings vs. bytes dilemma in all situations.
   - Like JSON, our spec is **syntactic**.  We don't specify a mapping from J8
     strings to interior data types in any particular language.

<!--
## J8 Notation in As Few Words As Possible

J8 Strings are a superset of JSON strings:

Only valid unicode:

<pre style="font-size: x-large;">
u'hi &#x1f926; \u{1f926}'                  &rarr; hi &#x1f926; &#x1f926;
</pre>

JSON: unicode + surrogate halves:

<pre style="font-size: x-large;">
 "hi &#x1f926; \ud83e\udd26"               &rarr; hi &#x1f926; &#x1f926;
 "\ud83e"
</pre>

Any byte string:

<pre style="font-size: x-large;">
b'hi &#x1f926; \u{1f926} \yf0\y9f\ya4\ya6' &rarr; hi &#x1f926; &#x1f926; &#x1f926;
b'\yff'
</pre>

## Structured Formats

### JSON8

### TSV8

1. Required first row with column names
1. Optional second row with column types
1. Gutter Column

## J8 Strings - Unicode and bytes

Let's review JSON strings, and then describe J8 strings.

### Review of JSON strings

JSON strings are enclosed in double quotes, and may have these escape
sequences:

    \"   \\   \/
    \b   \f   \n   \r   \t
    \u1234

Properties of JSON:

- The encoded form must also be valid UTF-8.
- The encoded form can't contain literal control characters, including literal
  tabs or newlines.  (This is good for TSV8, because it means a literal tab is
  always a field separator.)

### J8 Description

There are 3 **styles** of J8 strings:

1. JSON strings `""`
1. `b''` strings
1. `u''` strings

`b''` strings have these escapes:

    \yff                # byte escape
    \u{1f926}           # code point escape.  UTF-16 escapes like \u1234
                        # are ILLEGAL
    \'                  # single quote, in addition to \"
    \"  \\  \/          # same as JSON
    \b  \f  \n  \r  \t  

(JSON-style double-quoted strings remain the same in J8 Notation; they do not
add the `\'` escape.)

Examples:

    b''
    b'hello'
    b'\\'
    b'"double" \'single\''
    b'nul byte \y00, unicode \u{1f642}'

`u''` strings have all the same escapes, but **not** `\yff`.  This implies that
they're always valid unicode strings.  (If JSON-style `\u1234` escapes were
allowed, they wouldn't be.)

Examples:

    u''
    u'hello'
    u'unicode string \u{1f642}' 

A string *without* a prefix, like `'foo'`, is equivalent to `u'foo'`:

     'this is a u string'  # discouraged, unless the context is clear

    u'this is a u string'  # better to be explicit

### What's representable by each style?

<style>
#subset {
    text-align: center;
    background-color: #DEE;
    padding-top: 0.5em; padding-bottom: 0.5em;
    margin-left: 3em; margin-right: 3em;
}
.set {
  font-size: x-large;     
}
</style>

These relationships might help you understand the 3 styles of strings:

<div id="subset">

<span class="set">Strings representable by `u''`</span><br/>
&equals; All Unicode Strings (no more and no less)

<b>&subset;</b>

<span class="set">Strings representable by `""`</span> (JSON-style)<br/>
&equals; All Unicode Strings <b>&cup;</b> Surrogate Half Errors

<b>&subset;</b>

<span class="set">Strings representable by `b''`</span></br>
&equals; All Byte Strings

</div>

Examples:

- The JSON message `"\udd26"` represents a string that's not Unicode &mdash; it
  has a surrogate half error.  This string is **not** representable with `u''`
  strings.
- The J8 message `b'\yff'` represents a byte string.  This string is **not**
  representable with JSON strings or `u''` strings.

### Assymmetry of Encoders and Decoders

A few things to notice about J8 **encoders**:

1. They can emit only `""` strings, possibly using the Unicode replacement char
   `U+FFFD`.  This is a strict JSON encoder.
1. They *must* emit `b''` strings to preserve all information, because `U+FFFD`
   replacement is lossy.
1. They *never* need to emit `u''` strings.
   - This is because `""` strings (and `b''` strings) can represent all values
     that `u''` strings can.  Still, `u''` strings may be desirable in some
     situations, like when you want `\u{1f642}` escapes, or to assert that a
     value must be a valid Unicode string.

On the other hand, J8 **decoders** must accept all 3 kinds of strings.

### YSH has 2 of the 3 styles

A nice property of YSH is that the `u''` and `b''` strings are valid code:

    echo u'hi \u{1f642}'  # u respected in YSH, but not OSH

    var myBytes = b'\yff\yfe'

This is useful for correct code generation, and simplifies the language.

But JSON-style strings aren't valid in YSH.  The two usages of double quotes
can't really be reconciled, because JSON looks like `"line\n"` and shell looks
like `"x = ${myvar}"`.

### J8 Strings vs. POSIX Shell Strings

When the encoded form of a J8 string doesn't contain a **backslash**, it's
identical to a POSIX shell string.  

In this case, it can make sense to omit the `u''` prefix.  Example:

<pre>
shell_string='hi &#x1f642;'

var ysh_str = u'hi &#x1f642;'

var ysh_str =  'hi &#x1f642;'  <span class="sh-comment"># same thing</span>
</pre>

An encoded J8 string has no backslashes when the original string has all these
properties:

1. Valid Unicode (no non-UTF-8 bytes).
1. No ASCII control characters.  All bytes are `0x20` and greater.
1. No backslashes or single quotes.  (All other required escapes are control
   characters.)

## JSON8 - Tree-Shaped Records

Now that we've defined J8 strings, we can define JSON8, an obvious extension of
JSON.

### Review of JSON

See <https://json.org>

    [primitive]     null   true   false
    [number]        42  -1.2e-4
    [string]        "hello\n"
    [array]         [1, 2, 3]
    [object]        {"key": 42}

### JSON8 Description

JSON8 is like JSON, but:

1. All strings can be J8 strings &mdash; one of the **3 styles** describe
   above.
1. Object/Dict keys may be **unquoted**, like `{age: 42}`
   - Unquoted keys must be a valid JS identifier name matching the pattern
     `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`.
1. **Trailing commas** are allowed on objects and arrays: `{"d": 42,}` and `[42,]`
1. C- and JavaScript-style single-line **comments** like `//`
   - No block comments, and no `#` comments

Example:

```
{ name: "Bob",  // comment
  age: 30,
  sig: b'\y00\y01 ... \yff',  // trailing comma, binary data
}
```

<!--
!json8  # optional prefix to distinguish from JSON

I think using unquoted keys is a good enough signal, or MIME type.

-->

## J8 Lines - Lines of Text

*J8 Lines* is another format built on J8 strings.

For example, to represent represent 4 filenames, simply use 4 lines:

      dir/my-filename.txt       # unquoted string is JS name and . - /
     "dir/with spaces.txt"      # JSON-style
    b'dir/with bytes \yff.txt'  # J8-style
    u'dir/unicode \u{3bc}'

Literal control characters like newlines are illegal in J8 strings, which means
that they always occupy **one** physical line.

- Leading spaces on each line are ignored, which allows aligning the quotes.
- Trailing spaces are also ignored, to aid readability.  That is, significant
  spaces must appear in quotes.

*J8 Lines* can be viewed as a degenerate case of TSV8, described in the next
section.

<!--

TODO: show grammar, which disallows anything but significant tabs/newlines, and
insignificant spaces)
-->

### Related

- <https://jsonlines.org/> - this allows not just strings, any value like `{}`
  and `[]`

## TSV8 - Table-Shaped Text

Let's review TSV, and then describe TSV8.

### Review of TSV

TSV has a very short specification:

- <https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/tab-separated-values>

Example:

```
name<TAB>age
alice<TAB>44
bob<TAB>33
```

Limitations:

- Fields can't contain tabs or newlines.
- There's no escaping, so unprintable bytes in field values result in an
  unprintable TSV file.
- Spaces are easy to confuse with tabs.

### TSV8 Description

TSV8 is like TSV with:

1. A `!tsv8` prefix and required column names.
2. An optional `!type` line, with types `Bool Int Float Str`.
3. Other optional column attributes.
4. Rows of data, each starting with an empty "gutter" column.

Example:

```
!tsv8   age     name    
!type   Int     Str     # optional types
!other  x       y       # more column metadata
        44        alice
        33        bob
         1       "a\tb"
         2      b'nul \y00'
         3      u'unicode \u{3bc}'
```

Types:

```
[Bool]      false   true
[Int]       JSON numbers, restricted to [0-9]+
[Float]     same as JSON
[Str]       J8 string (any of the 3 styles)
```

Rules for cells:

1. They can be any of 4 forms in J8 Lines:
   1. Unquoted
   1. JSON-style `""`
   1. `u''`
   1. `b''`
1. Leading and trailing whitespace must be stripped, as in J8 Lines.

TODO: What about empty cells?  Are they equivalent to `null`?  TSV apparently
can't have empty cells, as the rule is `[character]+`, not `[character]+`.

Column attributes:

- `!format` could be Instant / Duration?

### Design Notes

TODO: This section will be filled in as we implement TSV8.

- Null Issues:
  - Are bools nullable?  Seems like no reason, but you could be missing
  - Are ints nullable?  In SQL they probably are
  - Are floats nullable?  Yes, like NA in R.
  - Decoders can use a parallel typed column to indicate nulls?

- It's OK to use plain TSV in YSH programs as well.  You don't have to add
  types if you don't want to.


## Summary

This document described an upgrade of JSON strings:

- J8 Strings (in 3 styles)

And data formats that built on top of these strings:

- JSON8 - tree-shaped records
- J8 Lines - Unix streams
- TSV8 - table-shaped data

### Future Work

- Concrete syntax trees, with location information
- Textual IRs like WebAssembly

## FAQ

### Why are byte escapes spelled `\yff`, and not `\xff` as in C?

Because in JavaScript and Python, `\xff` is a **code point**, not a byte.  That
is, it's a synonym for `\u00ff`, which is encoded in UTF-8 as the 2 bytes `0xc3
0xbf`.

This is **exactly** the confusion we want to avoid, so `\yff` is explicitly
different.

One of Chrome's JSON encoders [also has this
confusion](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:base/json/json_reader.h;l=27;drc=d0919138b7951c1a154cf802a68aad7904b6f4c9).

### Why have both `u''` and `b''` strings, if only `b''` is technically needed?

A few reasons:

1. Apps in languages like Python and Rust could make use of the distinction.
   Oils doesn't have a string/bytes distinction (on the "interior"), but many
   languages do.
1. Using `u''` strings can avoid hacks like
   [WTF-8](http://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/), which is often required for
   round-tripping arbitrary JSON messages.  Our `u''` strings don't require
   WTF-8 because they can't represent surrogate halves.
1. `u''` strings add trivial weight to the spec, since compared to `b''`
   strings, they simply remove `\yff`.  This is true because *encoded* J8 strings
   must be valid UTF-8.

### Why not use double quotes like `u""` and `b""`?

J8-style strings could have used double quotes.  But single quotes make the new
styles more visually distinct from `""`, and it allows `''` as a synonym for
`u''`.

Compared to `""` strings, `''` strings don't have a UTF-16 legacy.

### How do I write a J8 encoder and decoder?

The list of errors at [ref/chap-errors.html](ref/chap-errors.html) may be a
good starting point.

TODO: describe the Oils implementation.

## Glossary

- **J8 Strings** - the building block for JSON8 and TSV8.  There are 3 similar
  syntaxes: `"foo"` and `b'foo'` and `u'foo'`.
- **JSON strings** - double quoted strings `"foo"`.
- **J8-style strings** - either `b'foo'` or `u'foo'`.

Formats built on J8 strings:

- **J8 Lines** - unquoted and J8 strings, one per line.
- **JSON8** - An upgrade of JSON.
- **TSV8** - An upgrade of TSV.
