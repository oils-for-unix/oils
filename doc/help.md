Oil Help
========

<!--
IMPORTANT: This doc is processed in TWO WAYS.  Be careful when editing.

To generate HTML:
- split_doc.py and then devtools/cmark.py

To generate text for bin/oil
- 'devtools/cmark.py' to render HTML, then 'make_help.py cards' to generate
  'card' files.

Subset of Markdown we use:
- **bold** for bold (italic doesn't work)
- `backticks` to generate <code> (ANSI: reverse?)
- [links] to generate <a href=""></a> (ANSI underline: then add to bottom?)
- 4 space indents  to generate <pre><code>
- fenced code blocks to generate <pre><code class="language-X">
  - we COULD syntax highlight now.  At least the comments and strings?

Note: <p> implies word wrapping!
  well that's good because then you can do it dynamically.
  note: Python has textwrap!

-->

This doc describes every aspect of Oil and OSH briefly, and is indexed by
keywords.

The `help` builtin prints portions of it.

You can also navigate this doc with the [help index](help-index.html).

<div id="toc">
</div>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

### Usage

This section describes how to use the Oil binary.

<h4 id="osh-usage"><code>bin/osh</code> Usage</h4>

    Usage: osh [OPTION]... SCRIPT [ARG]...
           osh [OPTION]... -c COMMAND [ARG]...

The command line accepted by `bin/osh` is compatible with `/bin/sh` and `bash`.

    osh -c 'echo hi'
    osh myscript.sh
    echo 'echo hi' | osh

It also has a few enhancements:

    osh -n -c 'hello'                    # pretty-print the AST
    osh --ast-format text -n -c 'hello'  # print it full

osh accepts POSIX sh flags, with these additions:

  -n             parse the program but don't execute it.  Print the AST.
  --ast-format   what format the AST should be in

<h4 id="oil-usage"><code>bin/oil</code> Usage</h4>

    Usage: oil  [OPTION]... SCRIPT [ARG]...
           oil [OPTION]... -c COMMAND [ARG]...

`bin/oil` is the same as `bin/osh` with a the `oil:all` option group set.  So
`bin/oil` also accepts shell flags.

    oil -c 'echo hi'
    oil myscript.oil
    echo 'echo hi' | oil

<h4 id="bundle-usage">App Bundle Usage</h4>

    Usage: oil.ovm MAIN_NAME [ARG]...
           MAIN_NAME [ARG]...

oil.ovm behaves like busybox.  If it's invoked through a symlink, e.g. 'osh',
then it behaves like that binary.  Otherwise the binary name can be passed as
the first argument, e.g.:

    oil.ovm osh -c 'echo hi'

<h4 id="config">Configuring the Shell</h4>

If the --rcfile flag is specified, that file will be executed on startup.
Otherwise:

- `bin/osh` runs `~/.config/oil/oshrc`
- `bin/oil` runs `~/.config/oil/oilrc`

Pass --rcfile /dev/null to disable this behavior.

<h4 id="config">Startup Files</h4>

History is read?


<h3>Lexing</h3>

<h4 id="comments">comments</h4>

A comment starts with `#` and goes until the end of the line.

    echo hi  # print a greeting

<h4 id="line-continuation">line-continuation</h4>

A backslash `\` at the end of a line continues the line without executing it:

    ls /usr/bin \
       /usr/lib \
       ~/src        # A single command split over three lines

<h3>Oil Lexing</h3>


<h4 id="single-command">single-command</h4>

The %%% prefix Starts a Single Command Over Multiple Lines (?)

This special lexer mode has several use cases:

Long command lines without trailing \

    %%% chromium-browser
        --no-proxy-server
        # comments allowed
        --incognito

Long pipelines or and-or chains without trailing \ 

    %%% find .
        # exclude tests
      | grep -v '_test.py'
      | xargs wc -l
      | sort -n

    %%% ls /
     && ls /bin
     && ls /lib
     || error "oops"

<h4 id="docstring">docstring</h4>

TODO

<h2 id="command">Command Language</h2>

### Commands

<h4 id="simple-command">simple-command</h4>

Commands are composed of words.  The first word may by the name of a shell
builtin, an Oil proc / shell "function", an external command, or an alias:

    echo hi               # a shell builtin doesn't start a process
    ls /usr/bin ~/src     # starts a new process
    myproc "hello $name"
    myshellfunc "hello $name"
    myalias -l
<!-- TODO: document lookup order -->

Redirects are also allowed in any part of the command:

    echo 'to stderr' >&2
    echo >&2 'to stderr'

    echo 'to file' > out.txt
    echo > out.txt 'to file'

<h4 id="semicolon">semicolon ;</h4>

Run two commands in sequence like this:

    echo one; echo two

or this:

    echo one
    echo two

<h3>Conditional</h3>

<h4 id="case">case</h4>

Match a string against a series of glob patterns.  Execute code in the section
below the matching pattern.

    path='foo.py'
    case "$path" in
      *.py)
        echo 'python'
        ;;
      *.sh)
        echo 'shell'
        ;;
    esac

<h4 id="if">if</h4>

Test if a command exited with status zero (true).  If so, execute the
corresponding block of code.

Shell:

    if test -d foo; then
      echo 'foo is a directory'
    elif test -f foo; then
      echo 'foo is a file'
    else
      echo 'neither'
    fi

Oil:

    if test -d foo {
      echo 'foo is a directory'
    } elif test -f foo {
      echo 'foo is a file'
    } else {
      echo 'neither'
    }

<h4 id="true">true</h4>

Do nothing and return status 0.

    if true; then
      echo hello
    fi

<h4 id="false">false</h4>

Do nothing and return status 1.

    if false; then
      echo 'not reached'
    else
      echo hello
    fi

### Iteration

#### for

For loops iterate over words.

Oil style:

    var mystr = 'one'
    var myarray = %(two three)

    for i in $mystr @myarray *.py; done
      echo $i
    done


Shell style:

    mystr='one'
    myarray=(two three)

    for i in "mystr" "${myarray[@]}" *.py; done
      echo $i
    done

Both fragments output 3 lines and then Python files on remaining lines.

### Control Flow

### Grouping

### Concurrency

### Redirects

#### redir-file

Three variants of redirecting stdout:

    echo foo > out.txt    # write to a file
    echo foo >> out.txt   # append to a file
    echo foo >| out.txt   # clobber the file even if set -o noclobber

Redirect stdin:

    cat < in.txt

<!-- They also take a file descriptor on the left -->


#### redir-desc

Redirect to a file descriptor:

    echo 'to stderr' >&2

<!--
NOTE: >&2 is just like <&2 
There's no real difference.
-->

#### here-doc

TODO: unbalanced HTML if we use \<\<?

    cat <<EOF
    here doc with $double ${quoted} substitution
    EOF

    myfunc() {
            cat <<-EOF
            here doc with one tab leading tab stripped
            EOF
    }

    cat <<< 'here string'

<!-- TODO: delimiter can be quoted -->
<!-- Note: Python's HTML parser thinks <EOF starts a tag -->

### Other Command

<h4 id="dparen">dparen ((</h4>

<h4>time</h4>

`time [-p] pipeline`

Measures the time taken by a command / pipeline.  It uses the `getrusage()`
function from `libc`.

Note that time is a KEYWORD, not a builtin!

<!-- Note: bash respects TIMEFORMAT -->

### Oil Keywords

#### const 

Initializes a constant name to the Oil expression on the right.

    const c = 'mystr'        # equivalent to readonly c=mystr
    const pat = / digit+ /   # an eggex, with no shell equivalent

It's either a global constant or scoped to the current function.

#### var

Initializes a name to the Oil expression on the right.

    var s = 'mystr'        # equivalent to declare s=mystr
    var pat = / digit+ /   # an eggex, with no shell equivalent

It's either a global or scoped to the current function.

#### setvar

Like shell's `x=1`, `setvar x = 1` either:

- Mutates an existing variable (e.g. declared with `var`)
- Creates a new **global** variable.

It's meant for interactive use and to easily convert existing shell scripts.

New Oil programs should use `set`, `setglobal`, or `setref` instead of
`setvar`.

#### set 

A shorter name for `setlocal` in the Oil language.  Requires `shopt -s
parse_set`, because otherwise it would conflict with the `set` builtin.  Use
`builtin set -- 1 2 3` to get the builtin, or `shopt -o` to change options.

#### setlocal

Mutates an existing variable in the current scope.  If it doesn't exist, the
shell exits with a fatal error.

#### setglobal

Mutates a global variable.  If it doesn't exist, the shell exits with a fatal
error.

#### setref

Mutates a variable through a named reference.  TODO: Show example.



### Coil Keywords

<h2 id="assign">Assigning Variables</h2>

### Operators

### Compound Data

#### array

Array literals in shell accept any sequence of words, just like a command does:

    ls $mystr "$@" *.py

    # Put it in an array
    a=(ls $mystr "$@" *.py)

In Oil, use [oil-array]($help).

### Builtins

### Oil Keywords

<!-- CONFLICT: This duplicates the above -->

## Oil Expression Language

### Functions

#### proc-decl

#### func-call

### Literals

#### oil-string

Oil strings appear in expression contexts, and look like shell strings:

    var s = 'foo'
    var double = "hello $world and $(hostname)"

However, strings with backslashes are forced to specify whether they're **raw**
strings or C-style strings:

    var s = 'line\n'    # parse error: ambiguous

    var s = c'line\n'   # C-style string
    var s = $'line\n'   # also accepted for compatibility

    var s = r'[a-z]\n'  # raw strings are useful for regexes (not eggexes)

#### oil-array

Like shell arays, Oil arrays accept anything that can appear in a command:

    ls $mystr @ARGV *.py

    # Put it in an array
    var a = %(ls $mystr @ARGV *.py)

### Regexes

<h2 id="word">Word Language</h2>

### Quotes

#### quotes

- Single quotes
- Double Quotes
- C-style strings: `$'\n'`

Also see [oil-string]($help).

### Substitutions

#### com-sub

Evaluates to the stdout of a command.  If a trailing newline is returned, it's
stripped:

    $ hostname
    example.com

    $ x=$(hostname)
    $ echo $x
    example.com

#### var-sub

Evaluates to the value of a variable:

    $ x=X
    $ echo $x ${x}
    X X

#### arith-sub

Shell has C-style arithmetic:

    $ echo $(( 1 + 2*3 ))
    7


#### tilde-sub

Used as a shortcut for a user's home directory:

    ~/src     # my home dir
    ~bob/src  # user bob's home dir

<h3>Var Ops</h3>

<h4 id="op-format">op-format</h4>

### I/O

These builtins take input and output.  They're often used with redirects.

<h4 id="read">read</h4>

    read FLAG* VAR*

Read a line from stdin, split it into tokens with the `$IFS` algorithm,
and assign the tokens to the given variables.  When no VARs are given,
assign to `$REPLY`.

Flags:

    -a ARRAY  assign the tokens to elements of this array
    -d CHAR   use DELIM as delimiter, instead of newline
    -n NUM    read up to NUM characters, respecting delimiters
    -p STR    print the string PROMPT before reading input
    -r        raw mode: don't let backslashes escape characters
    -s        silent: do not echo input coming from a terminal
    -t NUM    time out and fail after TIME seconds
              -t 0 returns whether any input is available
    -u FD     read from file descriptor FD instead of 0 (stdin)

  <!--  -N NUM    read up to NUM characters, ignoring delimiters -->
  <!--  -e        use readline to obtain the line
        -i STR    use STR as the initial text for readline -->

<h4 id="echo">echo</h4>

    echo FLAG* ARG*

Prints ARGs to stdout, separated by a space, and terminated by a newline.

Flags:

    -e  enable interpretation of backslash escapes
    -n  omit the trailing newline
<!--  -E  -->

Backslash sequences recognized by -e:

    \\         backslash
    \a         (unimplemented ?) alert (BEL)
    \b         backspace
    \c         stop processing remaining input
    \e         escape next character
    \f         form feed, equivalent to \n + 4 spaces
    \n         new line
    \r         carriage return, returns to the beggining of the line
    \t         horizontal tab
    \v         vertical tab
    \0NNN      print character specified as an octal value with 1 to 3 octal
               digits 
    \xHH       print character specified as an hexadecimal value with 1 to 2
               hex digits
    \uHHHH     Unicode character specified as an hexadecimal value with 1 to
               4 hex digits 
    \UHHHHHHHH Unicode character specified as an hexadecimal value with 1 to
               8 hex digits

<h4 id="readarray">readarray</h4>

Alias for `mapfile`.

<h4 id="mapfile">mapfile</h4>

    mapfile FLAG* ARRAY?

Reads lines from stdin into the variable named ARRAY (default
`${MAPFILE[@]}`).

Flags:

    -t       Remove the trailing newline from every line
<!--
  -d CHAR  use CHAR as delimiter, instead of the default newline
  -n NUM   copy up to NUM lines
  -O NUM   begins copying lines at the NUM element of the array
  -s NUM   discard the first NUM lines
  -u FD    read from FD file descriptor instead of the standard input
  -C CMD   run CMD every NUM lines specified in -c
  -c NUM   every NUM lines, the CMD command in C will be run
-->

### Run Code

<h4 id="source">source</h4>

    source SCRIPT ARG*

Executes SCRIPT with given ARGs in the context of the current shell.  It will
modify existing variables.

<h4 id="eval">eval</h4>

    eval ARG+

Creates a string by joining ARGs with a space, then runs it as a shell command.

Example:

     # Create the string echo "hello $name" and run it.
     a='echo'
     b='"hello $name"'
     eval $a $b

Tips:

`eval` is usually unnecessary in Oil code.  Using it can confuse code and
user-supplied data, leading to [security issues][].

Prefer passing single string ARG to `eval`.

[security issues]: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/048

<h4 id="trap">trap</h4>

    trap FLAG* CMD SIGNAL*

Registers the shell string CMD to be run after the SIGNALs are received.  If
the CMD is empty, then the signal is ignored.

Flags:

    -l  Lists all signals and their signal number
    -p  Prints a list of the installed signal handlers

Tip:

Prefer passing the name of a shell function to `trap`.

### Set Options

<h4 id="set">set</h4>

The set builtin modifies the shell's configuration and behavior.

<h4 id="shopt">shopt</h4>

The shopt builtin configures the shell.

### Working Dir

<h4 id="cd">cd</h4>

    cd FLAG* DIR

Changes the working directory of the current shell process to DIR.

If DIR isn't specified, change to `$HOME`.  If DIR is `-`, change to `$OLDPWD`
(a variable that the sets to the previous working directory.)

Flags:

    -L  Follow symbolic links, i.e. change to the TARGET of the symlink.
        (default).
    -P  Don't follow symbolic links.

<h4 id="pwd">pwd</h4>

    pwd FLAG*

Prints the current working directory.

Flags:

    -L  Follow symbolic links if present (default)
    -P  Don't follow symbolic links.  Print the link instead of the target.

<h4 id="pushd">pushd</h4>

<!--pushd FLAGS DIR-->
    pushd DIR
<!--pushd +/-NUM-->

Add DIR to the directory stack, then change the working directory to DIR.
Typically used with `popd` and `dirs`.

<!--FLAGS:
  -n  Don't change the working directory, just manipulate the stack 
NUM:
  Rotates the stack the number of places specified. Eg, given the stack
  '/foo /bar /baz', where '/foo' is the top of the stack, pushd +1 will move
  it to the bottom, '/bar /baz /foo'-->

<h4 id="popd">popd</h4>

    popd

Removes a directory from the directory stack, and changes the working directory
to it.  Typically used with `pushd` and `dirs`.

<h4 id="dirs">dirs</h4>

    dirs FLAG*

Shows the contents of the directory stack.  Typically used with `pushd` and
`popd`.

Flags:

    -c  Clear the dir stack.
    -l  Show the dir stack, but with the real path instead of ~.
    -p  Show the dir stack, but formatted as one line per entry.
    -v  Like -p, but numbering each line.

### Completion

<h4 id="complete">complete</h4>

The complete builtin registers completion policies for different commands.

<h4 id="compgen">compgen</h4>

The compgen builtin generates completion candidates inside a user-defined
completion function.

It can also be used in scripts, i.e. outside a completion function.

<h4 id="compopt">compopt</h4>

The compopt builtin changes completion options inside a user-defined completion
function.

<h4 id="compadjust">compadjust</h4>

The compadjust builtin adjusts COMP_ARGV according to specified delimiters,
and optionally set variables cur, prev, words (an array), and cword.  May also
set 'split'.

This is an OSH extension that makes it easier to run the bash-completion
project.

<h3>Shell Process</h3>

<h4 id="exec">exec</h4>

    exec BIN_PATH ARG*

Replaces the running shell with the binary specified, which is passed ARGs.
BIN_PATH must exist on the file system; i.e. it can't be a shell builtin or
function.

<h4 id="umask">umask</h4>

    umask MODE?

Sets the bit mask that determines the permissions for new files and
directories.  The mask is subtracted from 666 for files and 777 for
directories.

Oil currently supports writing masks in octal.

If no MODE, show the current mask.

<h4 id="times">times</h4>

    times

Shows the user and system time used by the shell and its child processes.
                
### Child Process

<h4 id="jobs">jobs</h4>

    jobs

Shows all jobs running in the shell and their status.

<h4 id="wait">wait</h4>

    wait FLAG* ARG

Waits for a a process to exit, and returns its status.

The ARG can be a PID (tracked by the kernel), or a job number (tracked by the
shell).  Specify jobs with the syntax `%jobnumber`.

If there's no ARG, wait for all child processes.

Flags:

    -n  Wait for the next process to exit, rather than a specific process.

<h4 id="ampersand">ampersand</h4>

    CMD &

The `&` language construct runs CMD in the background as a job, immediately
returning control to the shell.

The resulting PID is recorded in the `$!` variable.

<h4 id="fg">fg</h4>

    fg JOB?

Returns a job running in the background to the foreground.  If no JOB is
specified, use the latest job.

<!--<h4 id="bg">bg</h4>

The bg builtin resumes suspend job, while keeping it in the background.

bg JOB?

JOB:
  Job ID to be resumed in the background. If none is specified, the latest job
  is chosen. -->

### External

<h4 id="test">test</h4>

String tests:

    test STR
    test OP STR
    test STR OP STR

    [ STR ]
    [ OP STR ]
    [ STR OP STR ]


File tests:

    test TST FILE
    test FILE1 OP FILE2

    [ TST FILE ]
    [ FILE1 OP FILE2 ]


Arithmetic tests:

    INT1 OP INT2

    [ INT1 OP INT2 ]


Evaluates a conditional expression and returns 0 (true) or 1 (false) as result.
The number of elements in the expression depends on the type of test.

String tests:

    -n STR              True if STR is not empty. This is the default operation
                        if no test is specified.
    -z STR              True if STR is empty.
    STR1 = STR2         True if the strings are equal.
    STR1 != STR2        True if the strings are not equal.
    STR1 < STR2         True if STR1 sorts before STR2 lexicographically.
    STR1 > STR2         True if STR1 sorts after STR2 lexicographically.
                        Note: < and > should be escaped, eg: \< and \>

File tests:

    -a FILE  True if FILE exists (recommended to use -e instead).
    -b FILE  True if FILE is a block special file.
    -c FILE  True if FILE is a character special file.
    -d FILE  True if FILE is a directory.
    -e FILE  True if FILE exists.
    -f FILE  True if FILE is a regular file.
    -g FILE  True if FILE has the sgid bit set.
    -G FILE  True if current user's group is also FILE's group.
    -h FILE  True if FILE is a symbolic link.
    -L FILE  True if FILE is a symbolic link.
    -k FILE  True if FILE has the sticky bit set.
    -O FILE  True if current user is the file owner.
    -p FILE  True if FILE is a named pipe (FIFO).
    -r FILE  True if FILE is readable.
    -s FILE  True if FILE has size bigger than 0.
    -S FILE  True if FILE is a socket file.
    -t FD    True if file descriptor FD is open and refers to a terminal.
    -u FILE  True if FILE has suid bit set.
    -w FILE  True if FILE is writable.
    -x FILE  True if FILE is executable.
    FILE1 -nt FILE2  True if FILE1 is newer than FILE2 (mtime).
    FILE1 -ot FILE2  True if FILE1 is older than FILE2 (mtime).
    FILE1 -ef FILE2  True if FILE1 and FILE2 are hard links.
<!--    -N FILE  True if FILE was modified since last read (mtime newer than atime).-->

Arithmetic tests:

    INT1 -eq INT2  True if the integers are equal.
    INT1 -ne INT2  True if the integers are not equal.
    INT1 -le INT2  True if INT1 is less or equal than INT2.
    INT1 -ge INT2  True if INT1 is greater than INT2.
    INT1 -lt INT2  True if INT1 is less than INT2.
    INT1 -gt INT2  True if INT1 is greater than INT2.

Other operators:

    -o OPTION  True if the shell option OPTION is set.
    -v VAR     True if the variable VAR has been set.
    EXPR1 -a EXPR2  True if expressions EXPR1 and EXPR2 are both true.
    EXPR1 -o EXPR2  True if either EXPR1 or EXPR2 are true.
    ! TEST          True, if TEST is false.
    ( TEST )        Group a test (for precedence). Note: parentheses should be
                    escaped: \( and \)
<!--    -R VAR     True if the variable VAR has been set and is a nameref variable. -->

Tips:

When using the "[" operator, don't forget to leave a space between the brackets
and the expression. "[" is a command, not syntax, so the shell will fail to
find the command without the spaces.

<h4 id="enable">enable</h4>

Bash has this, but OSH won't implement it.

#### repr

Displays the internal representation of a cell.  (Cells are locations for
values like strings and arrays.)

### Errors

### Globbing

#### nullglob

Normally, when no files match  a glob, the glob itself is returned:

    $ echo L *.py R  # no Python files in this dir
    L *.py R

With nullglob on, the glob expands to no arguments:

    shopt -s nullglob
    $ echo L *.py R
    L R

(This option is in GNU bash as well.)

#### dashglob

Do globs return results that start with `-`?  It's on by default in `bin/osh`,
but off when Oil is enabled.

Turning it off prevents a command like `rm *` from being confused by a file
called `-rf`.

    $ touch -- myfile -rf

    $ echo *
    -rf myfile

    $ shopt -u dashglob
    $ echo *
    myfile

### Debugging

### Other Option

### strict:all

#### strict_tilde

Failed tilde expansions cause hard errors (like zsh) rather than silently
evaluating to `~` or `~bad`.

#### strict_word_eval

TODO

#### strict_nameref

When `strict_nameref` is set, undefined references produce fatal errors:

    declare -n ref
    echo $ref  # fatal error, not empty string
    ref=x      # fatal error instead of decaying to non-reference

References that don't contain variables also produce hard errors:

    declare -n ref='not a var'
    echo $ref  # fatal
    ref=x      # fatal

#### parse_ignored

For compatibility, Oil will parse some constructs it doesn't execute, like:

    return 0 2>&1  # redirect on control flow

When this option is disabled, that statement is a syntax error.

<h2 id="env">Environment Variables</h2>

### Shell Options

<!-- CONFLICT: Duplicates the above -->

<h4 id="SHELLOPTS">SHELLOPTS</h4>

For the 'set' builtin.

<h4 id="BASHOPTS">BASHOPTS</h4>

For the 'shopt' builtin.

<h3>Other Env</h3>

<h4 id="HOME">HOME</h4>

$HOME is used for:

1. ~ expansion 
2. ~ abbreviation in the UI (the dirs builtin, \W in $PS1).

Note: The shell doesn't set $HOME.  According to POSIX, the program that
invokes the login shell sets it based on /etc/passwd.

<h4 id="PATH">PATH</h4>

A colon-separated string that's used to find executables to run.

<h4 id="IFS">IFS</h4>

Used for word splitting.  And the builtin split() function.

<h3>Completion</h3>

<h4 id="COMP_WORDS">COMP_WORDS</h4>

An array of words, split by : and = for compatibility with bash.  New
completion scripts should use COMP_ARGV instead.

<h4 id="COMP_CWORD">COMP_CWORD</h4>

Discouraged; for compatibility with bash.

<h4 id="COMP_LINE">COMP_LINE</h4>

Discouraged; for compatibility with bash.

<h4 id="COMP_POINT">COMP_POINT</h4>

Discouraged; for compatibility with bash.

<h4 id="COMPREPLY">COMPREPLY</h4>

User-defined completion functions should Fill this array with candidates.  It
is cleared on every completion request.

<h4 id="COMP_ARGV">COMP_ARGV</h4>

An array of partial command arguments to complete.  Preferred over COMP_WORDS.
The compadjust builtin uses this variable.

(An OSH extension to bash.)

<h3>Words</h3>

<h4 id="PS1">PS1</h4>

First line of a prompt.

<h4 id="PS2">PS2</h4>

Second line of a prompt.

<h4 id="PS3">PS3</h4>

For the 'select' builtin (unimplemented).

<h4 id="PS4">PS4</h4>

For 'set -o xtrace'.  The leading character is special.

### Collections

`len()`

- `len(mystr)` is its length in bytes
- `len(myarray)` is the number of elements
- `len(assocarray)` is the number of pairs

`copy()`:

```
var d = {name: value}

var alias = d  # illegal, because it can create ownership problems
               # reference cycles
var new = copy(d)  # valid
```

### Pattern

- `regmatch(/d+/, s)` returns a match object
- `fnmatch('*.py', s)`  returns a boolean

### String

### Better Syntax

These functions give better syntax to existing shell constructs.

- `shquote()` for `printf %q` and `${x@Q}`
- `lstrip()` for `${x#prefix}` and  `${x##prefix}`
- `rstrip()` for `${x%suffix}` and  `${x%%suffix}` 
- `lstripglob()` and `rstripglob()` for slow, legacy glob
- `upper()` for `${x^^}`
- `lower()` for `${x,,}`
- `strftime()`: hidden in `printf`

### Arrays

- `index(A, item)` is like the awk function

### Assoc Arrays

- `@names()`
- `values()`.  Problem: these aren't all strings?

### Block

<h3>libc</h3>

<h4 id="strftime">strftime()</h4>

Useful for logging callbacks.  NOTE: bash has this with the obscure printf
'%(...)' syntax.
