Oil Help
========

<!--
IMPORTANT: This doc is processed in TWO WAYS.  Be careful when editing.

To generate HTML:
- split_doc.py and then devtools/cmark.py

To generate text for bin/oil
- 'devtools/cmark.py' to render HTML, then 'make_help.py cards' to generate
  'card' files.

Subset of Markdown we use:
- **bold** for bold (italic doesn't work)
- `backticks` to generate <code> (ANSI: reverse?)
- [links] to generate <a href=""></a> (ANSI underline: then add to bottom?)
- 4 space indents  to generate <pre><code>
- fenced code blocks to generate <pre><code class="language-X">
  - we COULD syntax highlight now.  At least the comments and strings?

Note: <p> implies word wrapping!
  well that's good because then you can do it dynamically.
  note: Python has textwrap!

-->

This doc describes every aspect of Oil and OSH briefly, and is indexed by
keywords.

The `help` builtin prints portions of it.

You can also navigate this doc with the [help index](help-index.html).

TODO:

- <h4> also needs anchors generated
  - but not in TOC

- cross ref bash?  <a href="$:bash"></a>
  - links appear below the card?

- Check that the cards don't go over 80 chars

- Have a way to mark cards as DEPRECATED
  - dparen ((
  - <h4 deprecated=true>dparen ((</h4>
  - <h4 class="deprecated">dparen ((</h4>
    - well this is not in the TOC.  But the heading itself should be GREY
      instead of BLUE
    - but what about in the quick-ref-index?  Can we somehow mark it there?

help cmd vars

h2: groups (of sections)
h3: sections
h4: topic/cards

<h2 tag="cmd"></h2>

- And then on the web display them SIDE BY SIDE
- At least two columns, maybe THREE!
- Display mobile CSS

_devbuild/gen/quick-ref should just have a flat list of IDs then?
or maybe <div class="card" id="foo"></div> can override the default <h4>
processing?

- h2 and h4 have explicit #anchor
- h3 has autogenerated anchor, with #Operators, etc.
  - or actually you could have Usage -> Command Line usage

<div id="toc">
</div>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

### Usage

This section describes how to use the Oil binary.

<h4 id="osh-usage"><code>bin/osh</code> Usage</h4>

    Usage: osh [OPTION]... SCRIPT [ARG]...
           osh [OPTION]... -c COMMAND [ARG]...

The command line accepted by `bin/osh` is compatible with `/bin/sh` and `bash`.

    osh -c 'echo hi'
    osh myscript.sh
    echo 'echo hi' | osh

It also has a few enhancements:

    osh -n -c 'hello'                    # pretty-print the AST
    osh --ast-format text -n -c 'hello'  # print it full

osh accepts POSIX sh flags, with these additions:

  -n             parse the program but don't execute it.  Print the AST.
  --ast-format   what format the AST should be in

<h4 id="oil-usage"><code>bin/oil</code> Usage</h4>

    Usage: oil  [OPTION]... SCRIPT [ARG]...
           oil [OPTION]... -c COMMAND [ARG]...

`bin/oil` is the same as `bin/osh` with a the `oil:all` option group set.  So
`bin/oil` also accepts shell flags.

    oil -c 'echo hi'
    oil myscript.oil
    echo 'echo hi' | oil

<h4 id="bundle-usage">App Bundle Usage</h4>

    Usage: oil.ovm MAIN_NAME [ARG]...
           MAIN_NAME [ARG]...

oil.ovm behaves like busybox.  If it's invoked through a symlink, e.g. 'osh',
then it behaves like that binary.  Otherwise the binary name can be passed as
the first argument, e.g.:

    oil.ovm osh -c 'echo hi'

<h4 id="config">Configuring the Shell</h4>

If the --rcfile flag is specified, that file will be executed on startup.
Otherwise:

- `bin/osh` runs `~/.config/oil/oshrc`
- `bin/oil` runs `~/.config/oil/oilrc`

Pass --rcfile /dev/null to disable this behavior.

<h4 id="config">Startup Files</h4>

History is read?


<h3>Lexing</h3>

<h4 id="comments">comments</h4>

A comment starts with `#` and goes until the end of the line.

    echo hi  # print a greeting

<h4 id="line-continuation">line-continuation</h4>

A backslash `\` at the end of a line continues the line without executing it:

    ls /usr/bin \
       /usr/lib \
       ~/src        # A single command split over three lines

<h3>Oil Lexing</h3>


<h4 id="single-command">single-command</h4>

The %%% prefix Starts a Single Command Over Multiple Lines (?)

This special lexer mode has several use cases:

Long command lines without trailing \

    %%% chromium-browser
        --no-proxy-server
        # comments allowed
        --incognito

Long pipelines or and-or chains without trailing \ 

    %%% find .
        # exclude tests
      | grep -v '_test.py'
      | xargs wc -l
      | sort -n

    %%% ls /
     && ls /bin
     && ls /lib
     || error "oops"

<h4 id="docstring">docstring</h4>

TODO

<h2 id="command">Command Language</h2>

### Commands

<h4 id="simple-command">simple-command</h4>

Commands are composed of words.  The first word may by the name of a shell
builtin, an Oil proc / shell "function", an external command, or an alias:

    echo hi               # a shell builtin doesn't start a process
    ls /usr/bin ~/src     # starts a new process
    myproc "hello $name"
    myshellfunc "hello $name"
    myalias -l
<!-- TODO: document lookup order -->

Redirects are also allowed in any part of the command:

    echo 'to stderr' >&2
    echo >&2 'to stderr'

    echo 'to file' > out.txt
    echo > out.txt 'to file'

<h4 id="semicolon">semicolon ;</h4>

Run two commands in sequence like this:

    echo one; echo two

or this:

    echo one
    echo two

<h3>Conditional</h3>

<h4 id="case">case</h4>

Match a string against a series of glob patterns.  Execute code in the section
below the matching pattern.

    path='foo.py'
    case "$path" in
      *.py)
        echo 'python'
        ;;
      *.sh)
        echo 'shell'
        ;;
    esac

<h4 id="if">if</h4>

Test if a command exited with status zero (true).  If so, execute the
corresponding block of code.

Shell:

    if test -d foo; then
      echo 'foo is a directory'
    elif test -f foo; then
      echo 'foo is a file'
    else
      echo 'neither'
    fi

Oil:

    if test -d foo {
      echo 'foo is a directory'
    } elif test -f foo {
      echo 'foo is a file'
    } else {
      echo 'neither'
    }

<h4 id="true">true</h4>

Do nothing and return status 0.

    if true; then
      echo hello
    fi

<h4 id="false">false</h4>

Do nothing and return status 1.

    if false; then
      echo 'not reached'
    else
      echo hello
    fi

### Iteration

#### for

For loops iterate over words.

Oil style:

    var mystr = 'one'
    var myarray = @(two three)

    for i in $mystr @myarray *.py; done
      echo $i
    done


Shell style:

    mystr='one'
    myarray=(two three)

    for i in "mystr" "${myarray[@]}" *.py; done
      echo $i
    done

Both fragments output 3 lines and then Python files on remaining lines.

### Control Flow

### Grouping

### Concurrency

### Redirects

#### redir-file

Three variants of redirecting stdout:

    echo foo > out.txt    # write to a file
    echo foo >> out.txt   # append to a file
    echo foo >| out.txt   # clobber the file even if set -o noclobber

Redirect stdin:

    cat < in.txt

<!-- They also take a file descriptor on the left -->


#### redir-desc

Redirect to a file descriptor:

    echo 'to stderr' >&2

<!--
NOTE: >&2 is just like <&2 
There's no real difference.
-->

#### here-doc

TODO: unbalanced HTML if we use \<\<?

    cat <<EOF
    here doc with $double ${quoted} substitution
    EOF

    myfunc() {
            cat <<-EOF
            here doc with one tab leading tab stripped
            EOF
    }

    cat <<< 'here string'

<!-- TODO: delimiter can be quoted -->
<!-- Note: Python's HTML parser thinks <EOF starts a tag -->

### Other Command

<h4 id="dparen">dparen ((</h4>

<h4>time</h4>

`time [-p] pipeline`

Measures the time taken by a command / pipeline.  It uses the `getrusage()`
function from `libc`.

Note that time is a KEYWORD, not a builtin!

<!-- Note: bash respects TIMEFORMAT -->

### Oil Keywords

#### const 

Initializes a constant name to the Oil expression on the right.

    const c = 'mystr'        # equivalent to readonly c=mystr
    const pat = / digit+ /   # an eggex, with no shell equivalent

It's either a global constant or scoped to the current function.

#### var

Initializes a name to the Oil expression on the right.

    var s = 'mystr'        # equivalent to declare s=mystr
    var pat = / digit+ /   # an eggex, with no shell equivalent

It's either a global or scoped to the current function.

#### setvar

Like shell's `x=1`, `setvar x = 1` either:

- Mutates an existing variable (e.g. declared with `var`)
- Creates a new **global** variable.

It's meant for interactive use and to easily convert existing shell scripts.

New Oil programs should use `set`, `setglobal`, or `setref` instead of
`setvar`.

#### set 

Mutates an existing variable in the current scope.  If it doesn't exist, the
shell exits with a fatal error.

#### setglobal

Mutates a global variable.  If it doesn't exist, the shell exits with a fatal
error.

#### setref

Mutates a variable through a named reference.  TODO: Show example.



### Coil Keywords

<h2 id="assign">Assigning Variables</h2>

### Operators

### Compound Data

#### array

Array literals in shell accept any sequence of words, just like a command does:

    ls $mystr "$@" *.py

    # Put it in an array
    a=(ls $mystr "$@" *.py)

In Oil, use [oil-array]($help).

### Builtins

### Oil Keywords

<!-- CONFLICT: This duplicates the above -->

## Oil Expression Language

### Functions

#### proc-decl

#### func-call

### Literals

#### oil-string

Oil strings appear in expression contexts, and look like shell strings:

    var s = 'foo'
    var double = "hello $world and $(hostname)"

However, strings with backslashes are forced to specify whether they're **raw**
strings or C-style strings:

    var s = 'line\n'    # parse error: ambiguous

    var s = c'line\n'   # C-style string
    var s = $'line\n'   # also accepted for compatibility

    var s = r'[a-z]\n'  # raw strings are useful for regexes (not eggexes)

#### oil-array

Like shell arays, Oil arrays accept anything that can appear in a command:

    ls $mystr @ARGV *.py

    # Put it in an array
    var a = @(ls $mystr @ARGV *.py)

### Regexes

<h2 id="word">Word Language</h2>

### Quotes

#### quotes

- Single quotes
- Double Quotes
- C-style strings: `$'\n'`

Also see [oil-string]($help).

### Substitutions

#### com-sub

Evaluates to the stdout of a command.  If a trailing newline is returned, it's
stripped:

    $ hostname
    example.com

    $ x=$(hostname)
    $ echo $x
    example.com

#### var-sub

Evaluates to the value of a variable:

    $ x=X
    $ echo $x ${x}
    X X

#### arith-sub

Shell has C-style arithmetic:

    $ echo $(( 1 + 2*3 ))
    7


#### tilde-sub

Used as a shortcut for a user's home directory:

    ~/src     # my home dir
    ~bob/src  # user bob's home dir

<h3>Word Lookup</h3>

### Oil Builtins

<h2 id="option">Shell Options</h2>

### Errors

### Globbing

#### nullglob

Normally, when no files match  a glob, the glob itself is returned:

    $ echo L *.py R  # no Python files in this dir
    L *.py R

With nullglob on, the glob expands to no arguments:

    shopt -s nullglob
    $ echo L *.py R
    L R

(This option is in GNU bash as well.)

#### dashglob

Do globs return results that start with `-`?  It's on by default in `bin/osh`,
but off when Oil is enabled.

Turning it off prevents a command like `rm *` from being confused by a file
called `-rf`.

    $ touch -- myfile -rf

    $ echo *
    -rf myfile

    $ shopt -u dashglob
    $ echo *
    myfile

### Debugging

### Interactive

### Other Option

### strict:all

#### strict_tilde

TODO: Failed tilde expansions don't evaluate to code.

#### strict_word_eval

TODO

#### strict_nameref

When `strict_nameref` is set, undefined references produce fatal errors:

    declare -n ref
    echo $ref  # fatal error, not empty string
    ref=x      # fatal error instead of decaying to non-reference

References that don't contain variables also produce hard errors:

    declare -n ref='not a var'
    echo $ref  # fatal
    ref=x      # fatal

### Shell Options

<!-- CONFLICT: Duplicates the above -->

<h4 id="SHELLOPTS">SHELLOPTS</h4>

For the 'set' builtin.

<h4 id="BASHOPTS">BASHOPTS</h4>

For the 'shopt' builtin.

<h3>Other Env</h3>

<h4 id="HOME">HOME</h4>

$HOME is used for:

1. ~ expansion 
2. ~ abbreviation in the UI (the dirs builtin, \W in $PS1).

Note: The shell doesn't set $HOME.  According to POSIX, the program that
invokes the login shell sets it based on /etc/passwd.

<h4 id="PATH">PATH</h4>

A colon-separated string that's used to find executables to run.

<h4 id="IFS">IFS</h4>

Used for word splitting.  And the builtin split() function.

<h3>Completion</h3>

### Other Plugin

<h2 id="lib">Oil Libraries</h2>

### Collections

`len()`

- `len(mystr)` is its length in bytes
- `len(myarray)` is the number of elements
- `len(assocarray)` is the number of pairs

`copy()`:

```
var d = {name: value}

var alias = d  # illegal, because it can create ownership problems
               # reference cycles
var new = copy(d)  # valid
```

### Pattern

- `regmatch(/d+/, s)` returns a match object
- `fnmatch('*.py', s)`  returns a boolean

### String

### Better Syntax

These functions give better syntax to existing shell constructs.

- `shquote()` for `printf %q` and `${x@Q}`
- `lstrip()` for `${x#prefix}` and  `${x##prefix}`
- `rstrip()` for `${x%suffix}` and  `${x%%suffix}` 
- `lstripglob()` and `rstripglob()` for slow, legacy glob
- `upper()` for `${x^^}`
- `lower()` for `${x,,}`
- `strftime()`: hidden in `printf`

### Arrays

- `index(A, item)` is like the awk function

### Assoc Arrays

- `@names()`
- `values()`.  Problem: these aren't all strings?

### Block

<h3>libc</h3>

<h4 id="strftime">strftime()</h4>

Useful for logging callbacks.  NOTE: bash has this with the obscure printf
'%(...)' syntax.
