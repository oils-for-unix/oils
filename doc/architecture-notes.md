Notes on OSH Architecture
=========================

## List of Regex-Based Lexers

Oil uses regex-based lexers, which are turned into efficient C code with
[re2c][].  We intentionally avoid hand-written code that manipulates strings
char-by-char, since that strategy is error prone; it's inevitable that rare
cases will be mishandled.

The list of lexers can be found by looking at `native/fastlex.c`:

- The huge combined OSH/Oil lexer.
- OSH lexers:
  - For `echo -e`
  - For `PS1` backslash escapes.
  - For history expansion, e.g. `!$`.
  - For globs, to implement `${x/foo*/replace}` via conversion to ERE.  We need
    position information, and the `fnmatch()` API doesn't provide it, but
    `regexec()` does.
    - NOTE: We'll also need one for converting extended globs to EREs, for
      portability.

## Parser Issues

This section is about extra passes ("irregularities") at **parse time**.  In
the "Runtime Issues" section below, we discuss cases that involve parsing after
variable expansion, etc.

### Where We Re-parse Previously Parsed Text (Unfortunately)

This makes it harder to produce good error messages with source location info.
It also implications for translation, because we break the "arena invariant".

(1) **Array L-values** like `a[x+1]=foo`.  bash allows splitting arithmetic
expressions across word boundaries: `a[x + 1]=foo`.  But I don't see this used,
and it would significantly complicate the OSH parser.

(in `_MakeAssignPair` in `osh/cmd_parse.py`)

(2) **Backticks**.  There is an extra level of backslash quoting that may
happen compared with `$()`.

(in `_ReadCommandSubPart` in `osh/word_parse.py`)

### Where VirtualLineReader is Used

This isn't necessarily re-parsing, but it's re-reading.

- alias expansion
- here documents:  We first read lines, and then parse them.

### Extra Passes Over the LST

These are handled up front, but not in a single pass.

- Assignment vs. Env binding detection: `FOO=bar declare a[x]=1`.
  We make another pass with `_SplitSimpleCommandPrefix()`.
  - Related: `s=1` doesn't cause reparsing, but `a[x+1]=y` does.
- Brace Detection in a few places: `echo {a,b}`
- Tilde Detection: `echo ~bob`, `home=~bob`

### Parser Lookahead

- `func() { echo hi; }` vs.  `func=()  # an array`
- precedence parsing?  I think this is also a single token.

### Lexer Unread

`osh/word_parse.py` calls `lexer.MaybeUnreadOne() to handle right parens in
this case:

```
(case x in x) ;; esac )
```

This is sort of like the `ungetc()` I've seen in other shell lexers.

### Where the Arena Invariant is Broken

- Here docs with <<-.  The leading tab is lost, because we don't need it for
  translation.

### Where Parsers are Instantiated

- See `osh/parse_lib.py` and its callers.

## Runtime Issues

### Where OSH Parses Code in Strings Formed at Runtime

(1) **Alias expansion** like `alias foo='ls | wc -l'`.  Aliases are like
"lexical macros".

(2) **Prompt strings**.  `$PS1` and family first undergo `\` substitution, and
then the resulting strings are parsed as words, with `$` escaped to `\$`.

(3) **Builtins**.

- `eval` 
- `trap` builtin
  - exit
  - debug
  - err
  - signals
- `source` â€” the filename is formed dynamically, but the code is generally
  static.

### Where Bash Parses Code in Strings Formed at Runtime (perhaps unintentionally)

All of the cases above, plus:

(1) Recursive **Arithmetic Evaluation**:

    $ a='1+2'
    $ b='a+3'
    $ echo $(( b ))
    6

This also happens for the operands to `[[ x -eq x ]]`.

NOTE that `a='$(echo 3)` results in a **syntax error**.  I believe this was due
to the ShellShock mitigation.

(2) The **`unset` builtin** takes an LValue.  (not yet implemented in OSH)

    $ a=(1 2 3 4)
    $ expr='a[1+1]'
    $ unset "$expr"
    $ argv "${a[@]}"
    ['1', '2', '4']

(3) **printf -v** takes an "LValue".

(4) **Var refs** with `${!x}` takes a "cell".  (not yet implemented OSH.
Relied on by `bash-completion`, as discovered by Greg Price)

    $ a=(1 2 3 4)
    $ expr='a[$(echo 2 | tee BAD)]'
    $ echo ${!expr}
    3
    $ cat BAD
    2

(5) **test -v** takes a "cell".

(6) ShellShock (removed from bash): `export -f`, all variables were checked for
a certain pattern.

### Parse Errors at Runtime (Need Line Numbers)

- [ -a -a -a ]
- command line flag usage errors
- alias parse errors

## Other Cross-Cutting Observations

### Shell Function Callbacks

- completion hooks registered by `complete -F ls_complete_func ls`
- bash has a `command_not_found` hook; osh doesn't yet

### Where Unicode is Respected

- `${#s}` -- length in code points
- `${s:1:2}` -- offsets in code points
- `${x#?}` and family (not yet implemented)

Where bash respects it:

- [[ a < b ]] and [ a '<' b ] for sorting
- ${foo,} and ${foo^} for lowercase / uppercase

### Parse-time and Runtime Pairs

- echo -e '\x00\n' and echo $'\x00\n' (shared in OSH)
- test / [ and [[ (shared in OSH)
- static vs. dynamic assignment.  `local x=$y` vs. `s='x=$y'; local $s`.
  - shells are very consistent here, but they have both notions!

### Other Pairs

- expr and $(( )) (expr not in shell)
- later: find and our own language

## Build Time

### Dependencies

- Optional: readline

### Borrowed Code

- All of OPy:
  - pgen2
  - compiler2 from stdlib
  - byterun
- ASDL front end from CPython (heavily refactored)
- core/tdop.py: Heavily adapted from tinypy

### Generated Code

- See `build/dev.sh`

## The OSH Parser

The OSH parser is better than other shell parsers:

- It statically parses interleaved sublanguages/dialects (e.g. the word
  language, arithmetic, etc.)
- `$PS2` just works (due to `_Peek()` and `_Next()`).  Other shells use special
  annotations in the parser to handle newlines.  (TODO: link them)
- It's used for interactive completion!  The `ParseContext()` collects
  "trails".
- It produces an LST, so it can be used for translation.  This structure could
  also be used for linting/reformatting.

Bad: it's a slower!  This needs to be fixed.

Where the parser is reused:

- The `eval` builtin.  (I'm sure bash does this too.)
- Expanding aliases.
- Parsing the prompt string `$PS1`, which may contain substitutions, and hence
  arbitrary code.  Also `$PS{2,4}`.
- For interactive completion.  (bash does NOT do this).
- Upcoming: for history expansion, e.g. `!$` to pick off the last word.  (bash
  does NOT do this.)

## State Machines

- `$IFS` splitting in `osh/split.py`
- compadjust needs to split partial `argv` by user-defined delimiters, e.g.
  `:=`
- TODO: Model the prompt and completion as a state machine
- outside example: vtparse.

The point of a state machine is to make sure all cases are handled!

## Where $IFS is Used

- Splitting of unquoted substitutions
- read
- To split words in `compgen -W` (bash only)
