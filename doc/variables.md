Variable Declaration, Mutation, and Scope
=========================================

This doc addresses these questions:

- How do variables behave in YSH?
- What are some practical guidelines for using them?

## YSH Design Goals

YSH is a graceful upgrade to shell, and the behavior of variables follows from
that philosophy.

- OSH implements shell-compatible behavior.
- YSH enhances shell with **new features** like expressions over typed data,
  which will be familiar to Python and JavaScript programmers.
- It's a **stricter** language.
  - Procs (shell functions) are self-contained and modular.  They're
    understandable by reading their signature.
  - We removed [dynamic scope]($xref:dynamic-scope).  This mechanism isn't
    familiar to most programmers, and may cause accidental mutation (bugs).
  - YSH has variable **declarations** like JavaScript, which can prevent
    trivial bugs.
- Even though YSH is stricter, it should still be convenient to use
  interactively.

## Keywords Are More Consistent and Powerful Than Builtins

YSH has 5 keywords affect shell variables.  Unlike shell builtins, they're
statically-parsed, and take dynamically-typed **expressions** on the right.

### Declare With `var` and `const`

It looks like JavaScript:

    var name = 'Bob'
    const age = (20 + 1) * 2

    echo "$name is $age years old"  # Bob is 42 years old

Note that `const` is enforced by a dynamic check.  It's meant to be used at the
top level only, not within `proc` or `func`.

    const age = 'other'  # Will fail because `readonly` bit is set

### Mutate With `setvar` and `setglobal`

    proc p {
      var name = 'Bob'       # declare
      setvar name = 'Alice'  # mutate

      setglobal g = 42       # create or mutate a global variable
    }

### "Return" By Mutating a `Place` (advanced)

A `Place` is a more principled mechanism that "replaces" shell's dynamic scope.
To use it:

1. Create a place with the `&` prefix operator
1. Pass the place around as you would any other value.
1. Assign to the place with its `setValue(x)` method.

Example:

    proc p (s; out) {  # place is a typed param
      # mutate the place
      call out->setValue("prefix-$s")
    }

    var x
    p ('foo', &x)  # pass a place
    echo x=$x  # => x=prefix-foo

- *Style guideline*: In some situations, it's better to "return" a value on
  stdout, and use `$(myproc)` to retrieve it.

### Comparison to Shell

Shell and [bash]($xref) have grown many mechanisms for "declaring" and mutating
variables:

- "bare" assignments like `x=foo`
- **builtins** like `declare`, `local`, and `readonly`
- The `-n` "nameref" flag

Examples:

    readonly name=World        # no spaces allowed around =
    declare foo="Hello $name"
    foo=$((42 + a[2]))
    declare -n ref=foo         # $foo can be written through $ref

These constructs are all discouraged in YSH code.

## Keywords Behave Differently at the Top Level (Like JavaScript)

The "top-level" of the interpreter is used in two situations:

1. When using YSH **interactively**.
2. As the **global** scope of a batch program.

Experienced YSH users may notice that `var` and `setvar` behave differently in
the top-level scope vs. `proc` scope.  This is caused by the tension between
the interactive shell and the strictness of YSH.

In particular, the `source` builtin is dynamic, so YSH can't know all the names
defined at the top level.

For reference, JavaScript's modern `let` keyword has similar behavior.

### Usage Guidelines

Before going into detail on keyword behavior, here are some practical
guidelines:

- **Interactive** sessions: Use shell's `x=y`, or YSH `setvar`.  You can think
  of `setvar` like Python's assignment operator: it creates or mutates a
  variable.
  - **Short scripts** (~20 lines) can also use this style.
- **Long programs**: Refactor them into composable "functions", i.e. `proc`.
  - First wrap the **whole program** into `proc main { }`.
  - The top level should only have `const` declarations.  (You can use `var`,
    but it has special rules, explained below.)
  - The body of `proc` and `func` should have variables declared with `var`.
  - Inside these code blocks, use `setvar` to mutate **local** variables, and
    `setglobal` to mutate **globals**.

That's all you need to remember.  The following sections explain the rationale
for these guidelines.

### The Top-Level Scope Has Only Dynamic Checks

The lack of static checks affects the recommended usage for both interactive
sessions and batch scripts.

#### Interactive Use: `setvar` only

As mentioned, you only need the `setvar` keyword in an interactive shell:

    ysh$ setvar x = 42   # create variable 'x'
    ysh$ setvar x = 43   # mutate it

Details on top-level behavior:

- `var` behaves like `setvar`: It creates or mutates a variable.  In other
  words, a `var` definition can be **redefined** at the top-level.
- A `const` can also redefine a `var`.
- A `var` can't redefine a `const` because there's a **dynamic** check that
  disallows mutation (like shell's `readonly`).

#### Batch Use: `const` only

It's simpler to use only constants at the top level.

    const USER = 'bob'
    const HOST = 'example.com'

    proc p {
      ssh $USER@$HOST ls -l
    }

This is so you don't have to worry about a `var` being redefined by a statement
like `source mylib.sh`.  A `const` can't be redefined because it can't be
mutated.

It may be useful to put mutable globals in a constant dictionary, as it will
prevent them from being redefined:

    const G = { mystate = 0 }

    proc p {
      setglobal G.mystate = 1
    }

### `proc` and `func` Scope Have Static Checks

These YSH code units have additional **static checks** (parse errors):

- Every variable must be declared once and only once with `var`.  A duplicate
  declaration is a parse error.
- `setvar` of an undeclared variable is a parse error.

## Procs Don't Use "Dynamic Scope"

Procs are designed to be encapsulated and composable like processes.  But the
[dynamic scope]($xref:dynamic-scope) rule that Bourne shell functions use
breaks encapsulation.
  
Dynamic scope means that a function can **read and mutate** the locals of its
caller, its caller's caller, and so forth.  Example:

    g() {
      echo "f_var is $f_var"  # g can see f's local variables
    }

    f() {
      local f_var=42 g
    }

    f

YSH code should use `proc` instead.  Inside a proc call, the `dynamic_scope`
option is implicitly disabled (equivalent to `shopt --unset dynamic_scope`).

### Reading Variables

This means that adding the `proc` keyword to the definition of `g` changes its
behavior:

    proc g() {
      echo "f_var is $f_var"  # Undefined!
    }

This affects all kinds of variable references:

    proc p {
      echo $foo         # look up foo in command mode
      var y = foo + 42  # look up foo in expression mode
    }

As in Python and JavaScript, a local `foo` can *shadow* a global `foo`.  Using
`CAPS` for globals is a common style that avoids confusion.  Remember that
globals should usually be constants in YSH.

### Shell Language Constructs That Write Variables

In shell, these language constructs assign to variables using dynamic
scope.  In YSH, they only mutate the **local** scope:

- `x=val`
  - And variants `x+=val`, `a[i]=val`, `a[i]+=val`
- `export x=val` and `readonly x=val`
- `${x=default}`
- `mycmd {x}>out` (stores a file descriptor in `$x`)
- `(( x = 42 + y ))`

### Builtins That Write Variables

These builtins are also "isolated" inside procs, using local scope:

- [read]($osh-help) (`$REPLY`)
- [readarray]($osh-help) aka `mapfile`
- [getopts]($osh-help) (`$OPTIND`, `$OPTARG`, etc.)
- [printf]($osh-help) -v
- [unset]($osh-help)

YSH Builtins:

- [compadjust]($osh-help)
- [try]($oil-help) and `_status`

<!-- TODO: should YSH builtins always behave the same way?  Isn't that a little
faster? I think read --all is not consistent.  -->

### Reminder: Proc Scope is Flat

All local variables in shell functions and procs live in the same scope.  This
includes variables declared in conditional blocks (`if` and `case`) and loops
(`for` and `while`).

    proc p {  
      for i in 1 2 3 {
        echo $i
      }
      echo $i  # i is still 3
    }

This includes first-class YSH blocks:

    proc p {
      var x = 42
      cd /tmp {
        var x = 0  # ERROR: x is already declared
      }
    }

## More Details

### Examples of Place Mutation

The expression to the left of `=` is called a **place**.  These are basically
Python or JavaScript expressions, except that you add the `setvar` or
`setglobal` keyword.

    setvar x[1] = 2                 # array element
    setvar d['key'] = 3             # dict element
    setvar d.key = 3                # syntactic sugar for the above
    setvar x, y = y, x              # swap

### Bare Assignment

[Hay](hay.html) allows `const` declarations without the keyword:

    hay define Package

    Package cpython {
      version = '3.12'  # like const version = ...
    }

### Temp Bindings

Temp bindings precede a simple command:

    PYTHONPATH=. mycmd

They create a new namespace on the stack where each cell has the `export` flag
set (`declare -x`).

In YSH, the lack of dynamic scope means that they can't be read inside a
`proc`.  So they're only useful for setting environment variables, and can be
replaced with:

    env PYTHONPATH=. mycmd
    env PYTHONPATH=. $0 myproc  # using the ARGV dispatch pattern

## Appendix A: More on Shell vs. YSH

This section may help experienced shell users understand YSH.

Shell:

    g=G                        # global variable
    readonly c=C               # global constant

    myfunc() {
      local x=X                # local variable
      readonly y=Y             # local constant

      x=mutated                # mutate local
      g=mutated                # mutate global
      newglobal=G              # create new global

      caller_var=mutated       # dynamic scope (YSH doesn't have this)
    }

YSH:

    var g = 'G'                # global variable (discouraged)
    const c = 'C'              # global constant

    proc myproc {
      var x = 'L'              # local variable

      setvar x = 'mutated'     # mutate local
      setglobal g = 'mutated'  # mutate global
      setvar newglobal = 'G'   # create new global
    }

## Appendix B: Problems With Top-Level Scope In Other Languages

  REPL](https://julialang.org/blog/2020/08/julia-1.5-highlights/#the_return_of_soft_scope_in_the_repl).
  - In contrast to Julia, YSH behaves the same in batch mode vs. interactive
    mode, and doesn't print warnings.  However, it behaves differently at the
    top level.  For this reason, we recommend using only `setvar` in
    interactive shells, and only `const` in the global scope of programs.

  - The behavior of `var` at the top level was partly inspired by this
    paper.  It's consistent with bash's `declare`, and similar to JavaScript's
    `let`.
