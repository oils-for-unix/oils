OSH Help
========

This doc describes every aspect of OSH briefly.  It underlies the `help`
builtin, and is indexed by keywords.

Navigate it with the [index of OSH help topics](osh-help-topics.html).

<!--
IMPORTANT: This doc is processed in TWO WAYS.  Be careful when editing.

It generates both HTML and text for the 'help' builtin.

<h2 id="command-lang">Command Language</h2>

### Commands

#### simple-command

Commands are composed of words.  The first word may by the name of a shell
builtin, an Oil proc / shell "function", an external command, or an alias:

    echo hi               # a shell builtin doesn't start a process
    ls /usr/bin ~/src     # starts a new process
    myproc "hello $name"
    myshellfunc "hello $name"
    myalias -l
<!-- TODO: document lookup order -->

Redirects are also allowed in any part of the command:

    echo 'to stderr' >&2
    echo >&2 'to stderr'

    echo 'to file' > out.txt
    echo > out.txt 'to file'

<h4 id="semicolon">semicolon ;</h4>

Run two commands in sequence like this:

    echo one; echo two

or this:

    echo one
    echo two

### Conditional

#### case

Match a string against a series of glob patterns.  Execute code in the section
below the matching pattern.

    path='foo.py'
    case "$path" in
      *.py)
        echo 'python'
        ;;
      *.sh)
        echo 'shell'
        ;;
    esac

#### if

Test if a command exited with status zero (true).  If so, execute the
corresponding block of code.

Shell:

    if test -d foo; then
      echo 'foo is a directory'
    elif test -f foo; then
      echo 'foo is a file'
    else
      echo 'neither'
    fi

Oil:

    if test -d foo {
      echo 'foo is a directory'
    } elif test -f foo {
      echo 'foo is a file'
    } else {
      echo 'neither'
    }

#### true

Do nothing and return status 0.

    if true; then
      echo hello
    fi

#### false

Do nothing and return status 1.

    if false; then
      echo 'not reached'
    else
      echo hello
    fi

#### colon

Like `true`: do nothing and return status 0.

#### bang 

Invert an exit code:

    if ! test -d /tmp; then   
      echo "No temp directory
    fi

#### and

    mkdir -p /tmp && cp foo /tmp

#### or

    ls || die "failed"

### Iteration

#### while

POSIX

#### until

POSIX

#### for

For loops iterate over words.

Oil style:

    var mystr = 'one'
    var myarray = :| two three |

    for i in $mystr @myarray *.py {
      echo $i
    }


Shell style:

    local mystr='one'
    local myarray=(two three)

    for i in "mystr" "${myarray[@]}" *.py; do
      echo $i
    done

Both fragments output 3 lines and then Python files on remaining lines.

#### for-expr-sh

A bash/ksh construct:

    for (( i = 0; i < 5; ++i )); do
      echo $i
    done

### Control Flow

These are keywords in Oil, not builtins!

#### break

Break out of a loop.  (Not used for case statements!)

#### continue

Continue to the next iteration of a loop.

#### return

Return from a function.

#### exit

Exit the shell process with the given status:

    exit 2

### Grouping

#### sh-func

POSIX:

    f() {
      echo args "$@"
    }
    f 1 2 3

#### sh-block

POSIX:

    { echo one; echo two; }

Note the trailing `;` -- which isn't necessary in Oil.

#### subshell

    ( echo one; echo two )

Use [forkwait]($osh-help) in Oil instead.

### Concurrency

#### pipe

#### ampersand

    CMD &

The `&` language construct runs CMD in the background as a job, immediately
returning control to the shell.

The resulting PID is recorded in the `$!` variable.

### Redirects

#### redir-file

Three variants of redirecting stdout:

    echo foo > out.txt    # write to a file
    echo foo >> out.txt   # append to a file
    echo foo >| out.txt   # clobber the file even if set -o noclobber

Redirect stdin:

    cat < in.txt

<!-- They also take a file descriptor on the left -->


#### redir-desc

Redirect to a file descriptor:

    echo 'to stderr' >&2

<!--
NOTE: >&2 is just like <&2 
There's no real difference.
-->

#### here-doc

TODO: unbalanced HTML if we use \<\<?

    cat <<EOF
    here doc with $double ${quoted} substitution
    EOF

    myfunc() {
            cat <<-EOF
            here doc with one tab leading tab stripped
            EOF
    }

    cat <<< 'here string'

<!-- TODO: delimiter can be quoted -->
<!-- Note: Python's HTML parser thinks <EOF starts a tag -->

### Other Command

<h4 id="dparen">dparen ((</h4>

#### h4

    time [-p] pipeline

Measures the time taken by a command / pipeline.  It uses the `getrusage()`
function from `libc`.

Note that time is a KEYWORD, not a builtin!

<!-- Note: bash respects TIMEFORMAT -->

<h2 id="assign">Assigning Variables</h2>

### Operators

#### sh-assign

#### sh-append

### Compound Data

#### sh-array

Array literals in shell accept any sequence of words, just like a command does:

    ls $mystr "$@" *.py

    # Put it in an array
    a=(ls $mystr "$@" *.py)

In Oil, use [oil-array]($oil-help).

#### sh-assoc

In Oil, use [oil-dict]($oil-help).

### Builtins

#### local

#### export

#### unset

#### shift

#### declare

#### typeset

Alias for [declare]($osh-help).

<h2 id="word">Word Language</h2>

### Quotes

#### quotes

- Single quotes
- Double Quotes
- C-style strings: `$'\n'`

Also see [oil-string]($oil-help).

### Substitutions

#### com-sub

Evaluates to the stdout of a command.  If a trailing newline is returned, it's
stripped:

    $ hostname
    example.com

    $ x=$(hostname)
    $ echo $x
    example.com

#### var-sub

Evaluates to the value of a variable:

    $ x=X
    $ echo $x ${x}
    X X

#### arith-sub

Shell has C-style arithmetic:

    $ echo $(( 1 + 2*3 ))
    7

#### tilde-sub

Used as a shortcut for a user's home directory:

    ~/src     # my home dir
    ~bob/src  # user bob's home dir

<h3>Var Ops</h3>

#### op-test

#### op-strip

#### op-replace

#### op-index

    ${a[i+1]}

#### op-slice

#### op-format

${x@P} evaluates x as a prompt string, e.g. the string that would be printed if
PS1=$x.

<h2 id="sublang">Other Shell Sublanguages</h2>

### Arithmetic

#### arith-context

#### sh-numbers

#### sh-arith

#### sh-logical

#### sh-bitwise

### Boolean

#### dbracket

Compatible with bash.

#### bool-expr

#### bool-infix

#### bool-path

#### bool-str

#### bool-other

### Patterns

#### glob

#### extglob

#### regex

Part of [dbracket]($osh-help)

### Other Sublang

#### braces

#### histsub

#### char-escapes

These backslash escape sequences are used in `echo -e`, [printf]($osh-help),
and in C-style strings like `$'foo\n'`:

    \\         backslash
    \a         alert (BEL)
    \b         backspace
    \c         stop processing remaining input
    \e         the escape character \x1b
    \f         form feed
    \n         newline
    \r         carriage return
    \t         tab
    \v         vertical tab
    \xHH       the byte with value HH, in hexadecimal
    \uHHHH     the unicode char with value HHHH, in hexadecimal
    \UHHHHHHHH the unicode char with value HHHHHHHH, in hexadecimal

Also:

    \"         Double quote.

Inconsistent octal escapes:

    \0NNN      echo -e '\0123'
    \NNN       printf '\123'
               echo $'\123'

TODO: Verify other differences between `echo -e`, `printf`, and `$''`.  See
`frontend/lexer_def.py`.

<h2 id="builtins">Builtin Commands</h2>

### I/O

These builtins take input and output.  They're often used with redirects.

#### read

    read FLAG* VAR*

Read a line from stdin, split it into tokens with the `$IFS` algorithm,
and assign the tokens to the given variables.  When no VARs are given,
assign to `$REPLY`.

Note: When writing Oil, prefer the extensions documented in
[oil-read]($oil-help).  The `read` builtin is confusing because `-r` needs to
be explicitly enabled.

Flags:

    -a ARRAY  assign the tokens to elements of this array
    -d CHAR   use DELIM as delimiter, instead of newline
    -n NUM    read up to NUM characters, respecting delimiters
    -p STR    print the string PROMPT before reading input
    -r        raw mode: don't let backslashes escape characters
    -s        silent: do not echo input coming from a terminal
    -t NUM    time out and fail after TIME seconds
              -t 0 returns whether any input is available
    -u FD     read from file descriptor FD instead of 0 (stdin)

  <!--  -N NUM    read up to NUM characters, ignoring delimiters -->
  <!--  -e        use readline to obtain the line
        -i STR    use STR as the initial text for readline -->

#### echo

    echo FLAG* ARG*

Prints ARGs to stdout, separated by a space, and terminated by a newline.

Flags:

    -e  enable interpretation of backslash escapes
    -n  omit the trailing newline
<!--  -E  -->

See [char-escapes]($osh-help).

#### printf

    printf FLAG* FMT ARG*

Formats values and prints them.  The FMT string contain three types of objects:

1. Literal Characters
2. Character escapes like `\t`.  See [char-escapes]($osh-help).
3. Percent codes like `%s` that specify how to format each each ARG.

If not enough ARGS are passed, the empty string is used.  If too many are
passed, the FMT string will be "recycled".

Flags:

    -v VAR  Write output in variable VAR instead of standard output.

Format specifiers:

    %%  Prints a single "%".
    %b  Interprets backslash escapes while printing.
    %q  Prints the argument escaping the characters needed to make it reusable
        as shell input.
    %d  Print as signed decimal number.
    %i  Same as %d.
    %o  Print as unsigned octal number.
    %u  Print as unsigned decimal number.
    %x  Print as unsigned hexadecimal number with lower-case hex-digits (a-f).
    %X  Same as %x, but with upper-case hex-digits (A-F).
    %f  Print as floating point number.
    %e  Print as a double number, in "Â±e" format (lower-case e).
    %E  Same as %e, but with an upper-case E.
    %g  Interprets the argument as double, but prints it like %f or %e.
    %G  Same as %g, but print it like %E.
    %c  Print as a single char, only the first character is printed.
    %s  Print as string
    %n  The number of characters printed so far is stored in the variable named
        in the argument.
    %a  Interprets the argument as double, and prints it like a C99 hexadecimal
        floating-point literal.
    %A  Same as %a, but print it like %E.
    %(FORMAT)T  Prints date and time, according to FORMAT as a format string
                for strftime(3). The argument is the number of seconds since
                epoch. It can also be -1 (current time, also the default value
                if there is no argument) or -2 (shell startup time).

#### readarray

Alias for `mapfile`.

#### mapfile

    mapfile FLAG* ARRAY?

Reads lines from stdin into the variable named ARRAY (default
`${MAPFILE[@]}`).

Flags:

    -t       Remove the trailing newline from every line
<!--
  -d CHAR  use CHAR as delimiter, instead of the default newline
  -n NUM   copy up to NUM lines
  -O NUM   begins copying lines at the NUM element of the array
  -s NUM   discard the first NUM lines
  -u FD    read from FD file descriptor instead of the standard input
  -C CMD   run CMD every NUM lines specified in -c
  -c NUM   every NUM lines, the CMD command in C will be run
-->

### Run Code

These builtins accept shell code and run it.

#### source

    source SCRIPT ARG*

Executes SCRIPT with given ARGs in the context of the current shell.  It will
modify existing variables.

#### eval

    eval ARG+

Creates a string by joining ARGs with a space, then runs it as a shell command.

Example:

     # Create the string echo "hello $name" and run it.
     a='echo'
     b='"hello $name"'
     eval $a $b

Tips:

`eval` is usually unnecessary in Oil code.  Using it can confuse code and
user-supplied data, leading to [security issues][].

Prefer passing single string ARG to `eval`.

[security issues]: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/048

#### trap

    trap FLAG* CMD SIGNAL*

Registers the shell string CMD to be run after the SIGNALs are received.  If
the CMD is empty, then the signal is ignored.

Flags:

    -l  Lists all signals and their signal number
    -p  Prints a list of the installed signal handlers

Tip:

Prefer passing the name of a shell function to `trap`.

### Set Options

The `set` and `shopt` builtins set global shell options.  Oil code should use
the more natural `shopt`.

#### set

    set FLAG* ARG*

Sets global shell options. Short style:

    set -e

Long style:

    set -o errexit

Set the arguments array:

    set -- 1 2 3

#### shopt

    shopt FLAG* OPTION* BLOCK?

Sets global shell options.

Flags:

    -s --set    Turn the named options on
    -u --unset  Turn the named options off
    -p          Print option values
    -q          Return 0 if the option is true, else 1

Examples: 

    shopt --set errexit

You can set or unset multiple options with the groups `strict:all`,
`ysh:upgrade`, and `ysh:all`.

If a block is passed, then the mutated options are pushed onto a stack, the
block is executed, and then options are restored to their original state.

### Working Dir

These 5 builtins deal with the working directory of the shell.

#### cd

    cd FLAG* DIR

Changes the working directory of the current shell process to DIR.

If DIR isn't specified, change to `$HOME`.  If DIR is `-`, change to `$OLDPWD`
(a variable that the sets to the previous working directory.)

Flags:

    -L  Follow symbolic links, i.e. change to the TARGET of the symlink.
        (default).
    -P  Don't follow symbolic links.

#### pwd

    pwd FLAG*

Prints the current working directory.

Flags:

    -L  Follow symbolic links if present (default)
    -P  Don't follow symbolic links.  Print the link instead of the target.

#### pushd

<!--pushd FLAGS DIR-->
    pushd DIR
<!--pushd +/-NUM-->

Add DIR to the directory stack, then change the working directory to DIR.
Typically used with `popd` and `dirs`.

<!--FLAGS:
  -n  Don't change the working directory, just manipulate the stack 
NUM:
  Rotates the stack the number of places specified. Eg, given the stack
  '/foo /bar /baz', where '/foo' is the top of the stack, pushd +1 will move
  it to the bottom, '/bar /baz /foo'-->

#### popd

    popd

Removes a directory from the directory stack, and changes the working directory
to it.  Typically used with `pushd` and `dirs`.

#### dirs

    dirs FLAG*

Shows the contents of the directory stack.  Typically used with `pushd` and
`popd`.

Flags:

    -c  Clear the dir stack.
    -l  Show the dir stack, but with the real path instead of ~.
    -p  Show the dir stack, but formatted as one line per entry.
    -v  Like -p, but numbering each line.

### Completion

These builtins implement Oil's bash-compatible autocompletion system.

#### complete

Registers completion policies for different commands.

#### compgen

Generates completion candidates inside a user-defined completion function.

It can also be used in scripts, i.e. outside a completion function.

#### compopt

Changes completion options inside a user-defined completion function.

#### compadjust

Adjusts `COMP_ARGV` according to specified delimiters, and optionally set
variables cur, prev, words (an array), and cword.  May also set 'split'.

This is an OSH extension that makes it easier to run the bash-completion
project.

<h3>Shell Process</h3>

These builtins mutate the state of the shell process.

#### exec

    exec BIN_PATH ARG*

Replaces the running shell with the binary specified, which is passed ARGs.
BIN_PATH must exist on the file system; i.e. it can't be a shell builtin or
function.

#### umask

    umask MODE?

Sets the bit mask that determines the permissions for new files and
directories.  The mask is subtracted from 666 for files and 777 for
directories.

Oil currently supports writing masks in octal.

If no MODE, show the current mask.

#### times

    times

Shows the user and system time used by the shell and its child processes.

### Child Process

#### jobs

    jobs

Shows all jobs running in the shell and their status.

#### wait

    wait FLAG* ARG

Wait for processes to exit.

If the ARG is a PID, wait only for that job, and return its status.

If there's no ARG, wait for all child processes.

<!--
The ARG can be a PID (tracked by the kernel), or a job number (tracked by the
shell).  Specify jobs with the syntax `%jobnumber`.
-->

Flags:

    -n  Wait for the next process to exit, rather than a specific process.

Wait can be interrupted by a signal, in which case the exit code indicates the
signal number.

#### fg

    fg JOB?

Returns a job running in the background to the foreground.  If no JOB is
specified, use the latest job.

<!--<h4 id="bg">bg</h4>

The bg builtin resumes suspend job, while keeping it in the background.

bg JOB?

JOB:
  Job ID to be resumed in the background. If none is specified, the latest job
  is chosen. -->

### External

#### test

    test OP ARG
    test ARG OP ARG
    [ OP ARG ]      # [ is an alias for test that requires closing ]
    [ ARG OP ARG ]

Evaluates a conditional expression and returns 0 (true) or 1 (false).

Note that [ is the name of a builtin, not an operator in the language.  Use
'test' to avoid this confusion.

String expressions:

    -n STR           True if STR is not empty.
                     'test STR' is usually equivalent, but discouraged.
    -z STR           True if STR is empty.
    STR1 = STR2      True if the strings are equal.
    STR1 != STR2     True if the strings are not equal.
    STR1 < STR2      True if STR1 sorts before STR2 lexicographically.
    STR1 > STR2      True if STR1 sorts after STR2 lexicographically.
                     Note: < and > should be quoted like \< and \>

File expressions:

    -a FILE          Synonym for -e.
    -b FILE          True if FILE is a block special file.
    -c FILE          True if FILE is a character special file.
    -d FILE          True if FILE is a directory.
    -e FILE          True if FILE exists.
    -f FILE          True if FILE is a regular file.
    -g FILE          True if FILE has the sgid bit set.
    -G FILE          True if current user's group is also FILE's group.
    -h FILE          True if FILE is a symbolic link.
    -L FILE          True if FILE is a symbolic link.
    -k FILE          True if FILE has the sticky bit set.
    -O FILE          True if current user is the file owner.
    -p FILE          True if FILE is a named pipe (FIFO).
    -r FILE          True if FILE is readable.
    -s FILE          True if FILE has size bigger than 0.
    -S FILE          True if FILE is a socket file.
    -t FD            True if file descriptor FD is open and refers to a terminal.
    -u FILE          True if FILE has suid bit set.
    -w FILE          True if FILE is writable.
    -x FILE          True if FILE is executable.
    FILE1 -nt FILE2  True if FILE1 is newer than FILE2 (mtime).
    FILE1 -ot FILE2  True if FILE1 is older than FILE2 (mtime).
    FILE1 -ef FILE2  True if FILE1 is a hard link to FILE2.
<!--    -N FILE  True if FILE was modified since last read (mtime newer than atime).-->

Arithmetic expressions coerce arguments to integers, then compare:

    INT1 -eq INT2    True if they're equal.
    INT1 -ne INT2    True if they're not equal.
    INT1 -lt INT2    True if INT1 is less than INT2.
    INT1 -le INT2    True if INT1 is less or equal than INT2.
    INT1 -gt INT2    True if INT1 is greater than INT2.
    INT1 -ge INT2    True if INT1 is greater or equal than INT2.

Other expressions:

    -o OPTION        True if the shell option OPTION is set.
    -v VAR           True if the variable VAR is set.

The test builtin also supports POSIX conditionals like -a, -o, !, and ( ), but
these are discouraged.

<!--    -R VAR     True if the variable VAR has been set and is a nameref variable. -->

Oil supports these long flags:

    --dir            same as -d
    --exists         same as -e
    --file           same as -f
    --symlink        same as -L

#### getopts

    getopts SPEC VAR ARG*

A single iteration of flag parsing.  The SPEC is a sequence of flag characters,
with a trailing `:` to indicate that the flag takes an argument:

    ab    # accept  -a and -b
    xy:z  # accept -x, -y arg, and -z

The input is `"$@"` by default, unless ARGs are passed.

On each iteration, the flag character is stored in VAR.  If the flag has an
argument, it's stored in `$OPTARG`.  When an error occurs, VAR is set to `?`
and `$OPTARG` is unset.

Returns 0 if a flag is parsed, or 1 on end of input or another error.

Example:

    while getopts "ab:" flag; do
        case $flag in
            a)   flag_a=1 ;;
            b)   flag_b=$OPTARG" ;;
            '?') echo 'Invalid Syntax'; break ;;
        esac
    done

Notes:
- `$OPTIND` is initialized to 1 every time a shell starts, and is used to
  maintain state between invocations of `getopts`.
- The characters `:` and `?` can't be flags.

#### kill

Unimplemented.

<!-- Note: 'kill' accepts job control syntax -->

### Introspection

All docs, including this reference:

    https://www.oilshell.org/release/$VERSION/doc/

#### hash

    hash

Display information about remembered commands.

    hash FLAG* CMD+

Determine the locations of commands using `$PATH`, and remember them.

Flag:

    -r       Discard all remembered locations.
<!--    -d       Discard the remembered location of each NAME.
    -l       Display output in a format reusable as input.
    -p PATH  Inhibit path search, PATH is used as location for NAME.
    -t       Print the full path of one or more NAME.-->

#### type

    type FLAG* NAME*

Print the type of each NAME.  Is it a keyword, shell builtin, shell function,
alias, or executable file?

Flags:

    -f  Don't look for functions
    -P  Only look for executable files in $PATH
    -t  Print a single word: alias, builtin, file, function, or keyword
<!--    -a  Print all executables that can run CMD, including files, aliases,
        builtins and functions. If used with -p, only the executable file will
        be printed.-->

 
<h3>Word Lookup</h3>

#### command

    command FLAG* CMD ARG*

Look up CMD as a shell builtin or executable file, and execute it with the
given ARGs.  That is, the lookup ignores shell functions named CMD.

Flags:

    -v  Instead of executing CMD, print a description of it.
        Similar to the 'type' builtin.
<!--    -p  Use a default value for PATH that is guaranteed to find all of the
        standard utilities.
    -V  Print a more verbose description of CMD.-->

#### builtin

    builtin CMD ARG*

Look up CMD as a shell builtin, and execute it with the given ARGs.  That is,
the lookup ignores shell functions and executables named CMD.

### Interactive

#### alias

    alias NAME=CODE

Make NAME a shortcut for executing CODE, e.g. `alias hi='echo hello'`.

    alias NAME

Show the value of this alias.

    alias

Show a list of all aliases.

Tips:

Prefer shell functions like:

    ls() {
      command ls --color "$@"
    }

to aliases like:

    alias ls='ls --color'
    
Functions are less likely to cause parsing problems.

- Quoting like `\ls` or `'ls'` disables alias expansion
- To remove an existing alias, use [unalias]($osh-help).

#### unalias

    unalias NAME

Remove the alias NAME.

<!--Flag:

    -a  Removes all existing aliases.-->

#### history

    history FLAG*

Display and manipulate the shell's history entries.

    history NUM

Show the last NUM history entries.

Flags:

    -c      Clears the history.
    -d POS  Deletes the history entry at position POS.
<!--    -a
    -n
    -r
    -w
    -p
    -s -->


### Unsupported

#### enable

Bash has this, but OSH won't implement it.

### Errors

### Globbing

#### nullglob

Normally, when no files match  a glob, the glob itself is returned:

    $ echo L *.py R  # no Python files in this dir
    L *.py R

With nullglob on, the glob expands to no arguments:

    shopt -s nullglob
    $ echo L *.py R
    L R

(This option is in GNU bash as well.)

#### dashglob

Do globs return results that start with `-`?  It's on by default in `bin/osh`,
but off when Oil is enabled.

Turning it off prevents a command like `rm *` from being confused by a file
called `-rf`.

    $ touch -- myfile -rf

    $ echo *
    -rf myfile

    $ shopt -u dashglob
    $ echo *
    myfile

<!-- CONFLICT: Duplicates the above -->

<h4 id="SHELLOPTS">SHELLOPTS</h4>

For the 'set' builtin.

<h4 id="BASHOPTS">BASHOPTS</h4>

For the 'shopt' builtin.

<h3>Other Env</h3>

<h4 id="HOME">HOME</h4>

$HOME is used for:

1. ~ expansion 
2. ~ abbreviation in the UI (the dirs builtin, \W in $PS1).

Note: The shell doesn't set $HOME.  According to POSIX, the program that
invokes the login shell sets it based on /etc/passwd.

<h4 id="PATH">PATH</h4>

A colon-separated string that's used to find executables to run.

<h4 id="IFS">IFS</h4>

Used for word splitting.  And the builtin split() function.
