Getting Started
===============

The project provides a **multi-purpose interpreter** (runtime).

- You can use it *interactively*, or run and write "shell scripts" for it.<br>
  (Shell is the best language for *ad hoc* automation.)
  
- You can start it to use a language that's *compatible* with other shells (using `bin/osh`),<br>
  or, to use the much improved Oil language, a very coherent *pitfall-freed* shell upgrade with<br>
  selected python/js/etc. features (using `bin/oil`).

As of 2021, the [OSH language][osh-language] is mature, and the [Oil
language][oil-language] is under development.  The interactive shell exists,
but it will be spartan until clients for the "[headless
shell](headless.html)" appear.  (You should still try it!)

See [blog posts tagged #FAQ][blog-faqs] for more detail.

### What Is Expected to Run Under OSH

"Batch" programs are most likely to run unmodified under OSH.  On the other
hand, Interactive programs like `.bashrc` and bash completion scripts may
require small changes.

- Wiki: [What Is Expected to Run Under OSH]($wiki)


### `sh` and Bash Docs Are Useful for OSH

Existing educational materials for the Unix shell apply to OSH, because they
generally don't teach the quirks that OSH disallows.  For example, much of the
information and advice in [BashGuide][] can be used without worrying about
which shell you're using.  See the end of this manual for more resources.

For this reason, we're focusing the documenting efforts on the [Oil
language][oil-language].




## Troubleshooting

- If you're running OSH from `bash` or `zsh`, then the prompt string `$PS1` may
  be unintentionally inherited.  Running `PS1=''` before `bin/osh` avoids this.
  This is also true for `$PS2`, `$PS4`, etc.
- On Arch Linux and other distros,`$LANG` may not get set without
  `/etc/profile`.  Adding `source /etc/profile` to your `oshrc` may solve this
  problem.





## Features Unique to OSH

### Dumping the AST

The `-n` flag tells OSH to parse the program rather than executing it.  By
default, it prints an abbreviated abstract syntax tree:

    $ bin/osh -n -c 'ls | wc -l'
    (command.Pipeline children:[(C {(ls)}) (C {(wc)} {(-l)})] negated:F)

You can also ask for the full `text` format:

    $ bin/osh -n --ast-format text -c 'ls | wc -l'
    (command.Pipeline
      children: [
        (command.Simple
          words: [
            (word.Compound
              parts: [(word_part.Literal
                       token:(token id:Lit_Chars val:ls span_id:0))]
            )
          ]
        )
        (command.Simple
          words: [
            (word.Compound
              parts: [(word_part.Literal
                       token:(token id:Lit_Chars val:wc span_id:4))]
            )
            (word.Compound
              parts: [(word_part.Literal
                       token:(token id:Lit_Chars val:-l span_id:6))]
            )
          ]
        )
      ]
      negated: F
      spids: [2]
    )

This format is **subject to change**.  It's there for debugging the parser, but
sophisticated users may use it to interpret tricky shell programs without
running them.


### `OSH_HIJACK_SHEBANG`

This environment variable can be set to the path of a **shell**.  Before OSH
executes a program, it will inspect the shebang line to see if it looks like a
shell script.  If it does, it will use this shell instead of the one specified
in the shebang line.

For example, suppose you have `myscript.sh`:

    #!/bin/sh
    # myscript.sh

    ./otherscript.sh --flag ...

and `otherscript.sh`:

    #!/bin/sh
    # otherscript.sh

    echo 'hello world'

Then you can run `myscript.sh` like this:

    OSH_HIJACK_SHEBANG=osh osh myscript.sh

and `otherscript.sh` will be executed with OSH rather than the `/bin/sh`.

Note that `osh` appears **twice** in that command line: once for the initial
run, and once for all recursive runs.

(This is an environment variable rather than a flag because it needs to be
**inherited**.)

### `--debug-file`

Print internal debug logs to this file.  It's useful to make it a FIFO:

    mkfifo _tmp/debug
    osh --debug-file _tmp/debug

Then run this in another window to see logs as you type:

    cat _tmp/debug

Related:

- The `OSH_DEBUG_DIR` environment variable is the inherited version of
  `--debug-file`.  A file named `$PID-osh.log` will be written in that
  directory for every shell process.
- The `--xtrace-to-debug-file` flag sends `set -o xtrace` output to that file
  instead of to `stderr`.

### Crash Dumps

- TODO: `OSH_CRASH_DUMP_DIR`

This is implemented, but a JSON library isn't in the release build.

### Bugs

- OSH runs shell scripts too slowly.  Speeding it up is a top priority.

  OSH and other shells.  They are unlikely to appear in real programs, or
