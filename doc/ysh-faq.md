YSH FAQ
=======

Here are some common questions about [YSH]($xref).  Many of the answers boil
down to the fact that YSH is a **smooth upgrade** from [bash]($xref).

Old and new constructs exist side-by-side.  New constructs have fewer
"gotchas".

## Can I freely mix OSH and YSH code?

*If YSH is equivalent to OSH with `shopt --set ysh:all`, it seems like this
could be possible?*

Currently we recommend only combining OSH and YSH when they're in **different
processes**.

While you may be able to source OSH from YSH like this:

```
shopt --unset ysh:all {
  source lib.osh
}
```

and perhaps source YSH from OSH like this:

```
shopt --set ysh:all
source lib.ysh
```

... actually calling shell functions and procs is **a problem**.  This is
because the `shopt` options are **global**, and you can end up with "mixed
stacks".

For example, consider a call stack that looks like :

```
OSH -> YSH -> OSH -> YSH
```

Reasoning about code mixed this way is difficult.

Instead, you may want limited mixing, where you "shell out" to OSH from YSH, or
vice versa.  This is similar to shelling out to `awk` from `sh`, for example.

(The [$0 Dispatch Pattern]($xref:0-dispatch) may be useful.)

## What's the difference `myvar`, `$myvar`, and `"$myvar"` ?

YSH is more like Python/JavaScript rather than PHP/Perl, so it doesn't use the
`$` sigil as much.

Never use `$` on the left-hand side:

    var mystr = "foo"   # not var $mystr

Use `$` to **substitute** vars into commands:

    echo $mystr
    echo $mystr/subdir  # no quotes in commands

or quoted strings:

    echo "$mystr/subdir"
    var x = "$mystr/subdir"

Rarely use `$` on the right-hand side:

    var x = mystr       # preferred
    var x = $mystr      # ILLEGAL -- use remove $
    var x = ${mystr:-}  # occasionally useful

    var x = $?          # allowed

See [Command vs. Expression Mode](command-vs-expression-mode.html) for more
details.

## How do I write `~/src` or `~bob/git` in a YSH assignment?

This should cover 80% of cases:

    var path = "$HOME/src"  # equivalent to ~/src

The old shell style will cover the remaining cases:

    declare path=~/src
    readonly other=~bob/git

---

This is only in issue in *expressions*.  The traditional shell idioms work in
*command* mode:

    echo ~/src ~bob/git
    # => /home/alice/src /home/bob/git

The underlying design issue is that the YSH expression `~bob` looks like a
unary operator and a variable, not some kind of string substitution.

Also, quoted `"~"` is a literal tilde, and shells disagree on what `~""` means.
The rules are subtle, so we avoid inventing new ones.

## How do I write the equivalent of `echo -e` or `echo -n`?

To echo special characters denoted by backslash escapes, use a
statically-parsed string literal, not `echo -e`:

    echo u'tab \t newline \n'       # YES: J8 style string is recommended in YSH
    echo $'tab \t newline \n'       #      bash-style string is also accepted

These styles don't work in YSH:

    echo -e "tab \\t newline \\n"   # NO: -e is printed literally
    echo -e "tab \t newline \n"     #     Error: Invalid char escape

To omit the trailing newline, use the `write` builtin:

    write -n       -- $prefix       # YES
    write --end '' -- $prefix       # synonym

    echo -n $prefix                 # NO: -n is printed literally

### Why Were `-e` and `-n` Removed?

The idioms with `u''` and `write` are more powerful and consistent.

Moreover, shell's `echo` is the *only* builtin that doesn't accept `--` to stop
flag processing.

That is, `echo "$flag"` always has a few bugs: when `$flag` is `-e`, `-n`,
`-en`, or `-ne`. There's **no** way to fix this bug in POSIX shell.

So portable shell scripts use:

    printf '%s\n' "$x"  # print $x "unmolested" in POSIX shell

We could have chosen to respect `echo -- $x`, but as YSH already has:

    write -- $x         # print $x "unmolested" in YSH

That allowed YSH to fix:

    echo $x $y ...      # YES: print single-lines "unmolested" in YSH

So `echo` is technically superfluous in YSH, but it's also short, familiar, and
always correct.

YSH isn't intended to be compatible with POSIX shell; only OSH is.

### How do I write a string literal with both `$myvar` and `\n`?

In YSH, either use `$[ \n ]` inside a double-quoted string:

    $ echo "$myvar $[ \n ] two"  # expression sub wraps \n
    value_of_myvar
    two

Or use the concatenation operator `++` with two styles of string literal:

    echo $[u'newline \n' ++ " $year/$month/$day"]

This POSIX shell behavior is probably not what you want:

    $ echo "\n"
    \n  # not a newline!

### How do I find all the `echo` invocations I need to change when using YSH?

A search like this can statically find most usages:

    $ egrep -n 'echo (-e|-n|-en|-ne)' *.sh
    test/syscall.sh:58: echo -n hi
    test/syscall.sh:76: echo -e '\t'

## What's the difference between `$(dirname $x)` and `$[len(x)]` ?

Superficially, both of these syntaxes take an argument `x` and return a
string.  But they are different:

- `$(dirname $x)` is a shell command substitution that returns a string, and
  **starts another process**.
- `$[len(x)]` is an expression sub containing a function call expression.
  - It doesn't need to start a process.
  - Note that `len(x)` evaluates to an integer, and `$[len(x)]` converts it to
    a string.

<!--
(Note: builtin subs like `${.myproc $x}` are meant to eliminate process
overhead, but they're not yet implemented.)
-->

## Why doesn't a raw string work here: `${array[r'\']}` ?

This boils down to the difference between OSH and YSH, and not being able to
mix the two.  Though they look similar, `${array[i]}` syntax (with braces) is
fundamentally different than `$[array[i]]` syntax (with brackets).

- OSH supports `${array[i]}`.
  - The index is legacy/deprecated shell arithmetic like `${array[i++]}` or
    `${assoc["$key"]}`.
  - The index **cannot** be a raw string like `r'\'`.
- YSH supports both, but [expression substitution][expr-sub] syntax
  `$[array[i]]` is preferred.
  - It accepts YSH expressions like `$[array[i + 1]` or `$[mydict[key]]`.
  - A raw string like `r'\'` is a valid key, e.g.  `$[mydict[r'\']]`.

[expr-sub]: ref/chap-expr-lang.html#expr-sub

Of course, YSH style is preferred when compatibility isn't an issue.

No:

    echo ${array[r'\']}

Yes:

    echo $[array[r'\']]

A similar issue exists with arithmetic.

Old:

    echo $((1 + 2))   # shell arithmetic

New:

    echo $[1 + 2]     # YSH expression

<!--

## Why doesn't the ternary operator work here: `${array[0 if cond else 5]}`?

The issue is the same as above.  YSH expression are allowed within `$[]` but
not `${}`.

-->

## How do I combine conditional commands and expressions: `if (myvar)` and `if test -f`?

You can use the `--true` and `--false` flags to the [YSH test][ysh-test]
builtin:

    if test --true $[myvar] && test --file x {
        echo ok
    }

They test if their argument is literally the string `"true"` or `"false"`.

This works because the boolean `true` *stringifies* to `"true"`, and likewise
with `false`.

## Why do I lose the value of `p` in `myproc (&p) | grep foo`?

In a pipeline, most components are **forked**.  This means that `myproc (&p)`
runs in a different process from the main shell.

The main shell can't see the memory of a subshell.

---

In general, you have to restructure your code to avoid this.  You could use a proc with multiple outputs:

    myproc (&p, &grepped_output)

Or you could use a function:

    var out1, out2 = myfunc(io)

---

[The Unix Shell Process Model - When Are Processes
Created?](process-model.html) may help.

This issue is similar to the `shopt -s lastpipe` issue:

    $ bash -c 'echo hi | read x; echo x=$x'
    x=

    $ zsh -c 'echo hi | read x; echo x=$x'
    x=hi

In bash, `read` runs in a subshell, but in `zsh` and OSH, it runs in the main
shell.

## Why are `Dict` and `Obj` different types?

*JavaScript has a single Object type, while Python has separate dicts and
objects.*

In YSH, we draw a line between data and code.

- A `Dict` is pure **data**, and may correspond to JSON from untrusted sources.
- An `Obj` bundles both data and **code**, and can't be serialized by default.

You can create an `Obj` from a `Dict` with the `Obj` constructor.  Conversely,
you can get the first Dict in an object with [first(myobj)][first].

There is no special `__proto__` or `prototype` name, which reduces the
likelihood of "prototype pollution" vulnerabilities.

---

This is essentially the [Interior vs. Exterior][interior-exterior] distinction:
An Obj lives inside the shell process, while a Dict may come from outside the
process (user input).

## Why are `Command` and `Proc` different types?

*Could a `Command` be a `Proc` with no arguments?  Similarly, could an `Expr` be a
`Func` with no arguments?*

Procs and Funcs both push a new stack frame, and bind arguments to declared
parameters.

On the other hand, `Command` and `Expr` are more "raw" and flexible:

- They can be evaluated in different stack frames &mdash;
  e.g. `io->eval(b, in_captured_frame)`
- They can have "undeclared" variable bindings &mdash; 
  e.g. `io->eval(b, vars={x: 42})`.

In other words, they're low-level, reflective types that allow users to create
expressive APIs, like:

    cd /tmp {                    # Command literal (block)
      ls -l
    }
    my-table | where [size > 3]  # Expr literal

---

Another way to think about it: we could have removed procs from the core YSH
language, and implemented them in terms of command blocks and `io->eval()`.
But that seems too low-level!

## Why are byte escapes spelled `\yff`, and not `\xff` as in C?

The [J8 Notation FAQ](j8-notation.html#faq) answers this question.

## How do I append to a string?  Is there a `+=` or `++=` operator?

You can use any of these styles:

    var s = s ++ t      # like + in Python or JavaScript

    var s = "$s$t"      # like Unix shell

    var s = "$[s]$[t]"  # a bit easier to read

However, avoid such string concatenation in a loop.  It's algorithmically
faster to append to a `List`, and `join()` the strings at the end:

    var parts = []
    for s in @(seq 5) {
      call parts->append(s)
    }
    echo $[join(parts)]  # => '12345'
