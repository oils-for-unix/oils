YSH FAQ
=======

Here are some common questions about [YSH]($xref).  Many of the answers boil
down to the fact that YSH is a **smooth upgrade** from [bash]($xref).

Old and new constructs exist side-by-side.  New constructs have fewer
"gotchas".

## What's the difference `myvar`, `$myvar`, and `"$myvar"` ?

YSH is more like Python/JavaScript rather than PHP/Perl, so it doesn't use the
`$` sigil as much.

Never use `$` on the left-hand side:

    var mystr = "foo"   # not var $mystr

Use `$` to **substitute** vars into commands:

    echo $mystr
    echo $mystr/subdir  # no quotes in commands

or quoted strings:

    echo "$mystr/subdir"
    var x = "$mystr/subdir"

Rarely use `$` on the right-hand side:

    var x = mystr       # preferred
    var x = $mystr      # ILLEGAL -- use remove $
    var x = ${mystr:-}  # occasionally useful

    var x = $?          # allowed

See [Command vs. Expression Mode](command-vs-expression-mode.html) for more
details.

## How do I write `~/src` or `~bob/git` in a YSH assignment?

This should cover 80% of cases:

    var path = "$HOME/src"  # equivalent to ~/src

The old shell style will cover the remaining cases:

    declare path=~/src
    readonly other=~bob/git

---

This is only in issue in *expressions*.  The traditional shell idioms work in
*command* mode:

    echo ~/src ~bob/git
    # => /home/alice/src /home/bob/git

The underlying design issue is that the YSH expression `~bob` looks like a
unary operator and a variable, not some kind of string substitution.

Also, quoted `"~"` is a literal tilde, and shells disagree on what `~""` means.
The rules are subtle, so we avoid inventing new ones.

## How do I write the equivalent of `echo -e` or `echo -n`?

To echo special characters denoted by backslash escapes, use a
statically-parsed string literal, not `echo -e`:

    echo u'tab \t newline \n'       # YES: J8 style string is recommended in YSH
    echo $'tab \t newline \n'       #      bash-style string is also accepted

These styles don't work in YSH:

    echo -e "tab \\t newline \\n"   # NO: -e is printed literally
    echo -e "tab \t newline \n"     #     Error: Invalid char escape

To mix backslash escapes and var substitution, use the concatenation operator
`++`:

    echo $[u'tab \t' ++ " $year/$month/$day"]

To omit the trailing newline, use the `write` builtin:

    write -n       -- $prefix       # YES
    write --end '' -- $prefix       # synonym

    echo -n $prefix                 # NO: -n is printed literally

### Why Were `-e` and `-n` Removed?

The idioms with `u''` and `write` are more powerful and consistent.

Moreover, shell's `echo` is the *only* builtin that doesn't accept `--` to stop
flag processing.

That is, `echo "$flag"` always has a few bugs: when `$flag` is `-e`, `-n`,
`-en`, or `-ne`. There's **no** way to fix this bug in POSIX shell.

So portable shell scripts use:

    printf '%s\n' "$x"  # print $x "unmolested" in POSIX shell

We could have chosen to respect `echo -- $x`, but as YSH already has:

    write -- $x         # print $x "unmolested" in YSH

That, and having static string literals, allowed YSH to fix

    echo $x $y ...      # YES: print a single-line "unmolested" in YSH

So `echo` is technically superfluous in YSH, but it's also short, familiar, and
always correct.

YSH isn't intended to be compatible with POSIX shell; only OSH is.

### How do I find all the `echo` invocations I need to change when using YSH?

A search like this can statically find most usages:

    $ egrep -n 'echo (-e|-n|-en|-ne)' *.sh
    test/syscall.sh:58: echo -n hi
    test/syscall.sh:76: echo -e '\t'

## What's the difference between `$(dirname $x)` and `$[len(x)]` ?

Superficially, both of these syntaxes take an argument `x` and return a
string.  But they are different:

- `$(dirname $x)` is a shell command substitution that returns a string, and
  **starts another process**.
- `$[len(x)]` is an expression sub containing a function call expression.
  - It doesn't need to start a process.
  - Note that `len(x)` evaluates to an integer, and `$[len(x)]` converts it to
    a string.

<!--
(Note: builtin subs like `${.myproc $x}` are meant to eliminate process
overhead, but they're not yet implemented.)
-->

## Why doesn't a raw string work here: `${array[r'\']}` ?

This boils down to the difference between OSH and YSH, and not being able to
mix the two.  Though they look similar, `${array[i]}` syntax (with braces) is
fundamentally different than `$[array[i]]` syntax (with brackets).

- OSH supports `${array[i]}`.
  - The index is legacy/deprecated shell arithmetic like `${array[i++]}` or
    `${assoc["$key"]}`.
  - The index **cannot** be a raw string like `r'\'`.
- YSH supports both, but [expression substitution]($oil-help:expr-sub) syntax
  `$[array[i]]` is preferred.
  - It accepts YSH expressions like `$[array[i + 1]` or `$[mydict[key]]`.
  - A raw string like `r'\'` is a valid key, e.g.  `$[mydict[r'\']]`.

Of course, YSH style is preferred when compatibility isn't an issue.

No:

    echo ${array[r'\']}

Yes:

    echo $[array[r'\']]

A similar issue exists with arithmetic.

Old:

    echo $((1 + 2))   # shell arithmetic

New:

    echo $[1 + 2]     # YSH expression

<!--

## Why doesn't the ternary operator work here: `${array[0 if cond else 5]}`?

The issue is the same as above.  YSH expression are allowed within `$[]` but
not `${}`.
