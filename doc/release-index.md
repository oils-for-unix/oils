Oils 0.15.0
===========

<!-- NOTE: This file is published to /release/$VERSION/index.html -->

<span class="date">
<!-- REPLACE_WITH_DATE -->
</span>

This is the home page for version 0.15.0 of Oils, a Unix shell.  To use it,

1. Download a source tarball.
2. Build it and do a "smoke test", as described in [INSTALL][].

These steps take 30 to 60 seconds on most machines.  After installation, see
[Getting Started](doc/getting-started.html).

The associated **[quality page](quality.html)** shows test results, metrics,
and benchmarks.

[INSTALL]: doc/INSTALL.html

## Download

<!-- REPLACE_WITH_DOWNLOAD_LINKS -->

Note: `oil-$VERSION` is the slow Python build, while `oils-for-unix-$VERSION`
is the new, fast C++ build.

## What's New

- Details are in the [raw git change log](changelog.html).  Not all changes
  affect the release tarball.
- I sometimes write a [release announcement](announcement.html) with a
  high-level description of changes.
