YSH Language Influences
=======================

Almost all syntax in YSH comes from another language.  This doc lists some of
those influences.

It's mostly trivia for the curious, but it may help you remember the syntax.

## General Philosophy

At a high level, Oil is a bash-compatible shell language that adds features
from popular dynamic languages.

Its design is more conservative than that of other alternative shells.  Our
goals are to:

- **Preserve** what works best about shell: processes, pipelines, and files.
- **Clean up** the sharp edges like quoting, ad hoc parsing and splitting
- **Integrate** features from Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and the other languages
  listed below.

## Major Influences

### POSIX Shell

The command and word syntax comes from shell:

    ls | wc -l                        # pipeline
    echo $var "${var} $(hostname)"    # variable and command sub
    echo one; echo two                # sequence of commands
    test -d /tmp && test -d /tmp/foo  # builtins and operators

Oil's own shell-like extensions:

    echo $[42 + a[i]]                 # Expression substitution
    cd /tmp { echo hi }               # Block arguments

### bash and ksh

We implement many bash semantics, like "named references" for out variables:

    f() {
      local -n out=$1    # -n for named reference
      out=bar
    }

    myvar=foo
    f myvar
    echo $myvar          # prints "bar"

But clean up the syntax:   

    proc f(:out) {       # "out param" declared with :
      setref out = 'bar'
    }

    var myvar = 'foo'
    f :myvar             # caller prefixes the var name with :
    echo $myvar          # prints "bar"

<!--
Historical note: Usenix 93.  korn shell was used for GUIs and such!
-->

### Python

Oil's expression language is mostly Python compatible.  Expressions occur on
the RHS of `=`:

    var a = 42 + a[i]
    var b = fib(10)
    var c = 'yes' if mybool else 'no'

Proc signatures resemble Python:

    proc mycopy(src, dest='/tmp') {  # Python-like default value
      cp --verbose $src $dest
    }

Differences:

- Oil uses shell-like composition with "procs", not Python- or JavaScript-like
	functions.
- More differences in [Oil Expressions vs. Python](oil-vs-python.html).

### JavaScript

Oil uses JavaScript's dict literals:

    var d1 = {name: 'Alice', age: 10}  # Keys aren't quoted

    var d2 = {[mystr]: 'value'}        # Key expressions in []

    var name = 'Bob'
    var age = 15
    var d3 = {name, age}  # Omitted values taken from surrounding scope

Blocks use curly braces, so most code resembles C / Java / JavaScript:

    if (x > 0) {
      echo 'positive'
    } else {
      echo 'zero or negative'
    }

    var i = 5
    while (i > 0) {
      echo $i
      setvar i -= 1
    }

### Ruby

Oil has Ruby-like blocks:

    cd /tmp {
      echo $PWD  # prints /tmp
    }
    echo $PWD

    proc foo(x, &block) { run(block) }
    var myblock = &(echo $PWD)

(Julia has something like blocks too.)

The `:out` syntax for references to variable names also looks like Ruby (and
Clojure):

    read :line                   # populate $line variable
    push :myarray one two three  # append to array

### Perl

The `@` character comes from Perl (and PowerShell):

    var myarray = :| one two three |
    echo @myarray          # @ is the "splice" operator

    echo @[arrayfunc(x, y)]

    for i in @(seq 3) {    # split command sub
      echo $i
    }

Perl can be viewed as a mixture of shell, awk, and sed.  Oil is a similar
agglomeration of languages, but it's statically parsed.

### Julia

Multiline strings in Oil use similar whitespace stripping rules:

    proc p {
      # Because leading and trailing space are stripped, this is 2 lines long
      var foods = '''
      peanut
      coconut
      '''
    }

### Awk

Oil gets its regex match operator from Awk:

    if (mystr ~ /digit+/) {
      echo 'Number'
    }

(We don't use Perl's `=~` operator.)

### make, find and xargs

Features influenced by these languages are planned, but not implemented.

## Minor Influences

### Tcl

Oil uses `proc` and `setvar`, which makes it look something like Tcl:

     proc p(x) {
       setvar y = x * 2
       echo $y
     }

     p 3  # prints 6

But this is mostly superficial: Oil isn't homoiconic like Tcl is, and has a
detailed syntax.  It intentionally avoids dynamic parsing.

However, [Data Definition and Code Generation in Tcl (PDF)][config-tcl] shows
how Tcl can be used a configuration language:

    change 6/11/2003 {
      author "Will Duquette"
      description {
        Added the SATl component to UCLO.
      }
    }

Oil's blocks would allow this to be expressed very similarly:

    change 6/11/2003 {
      author  = "Will Duquette"
      description = '''
        Added the SATl component to UCLO.
      '''
    }

(This mechanism is still being implemented.)

### PHP

PHP has global variables like `_REQUEST` and `_POST`.

Oil will have `_argv`, `_match()`, `_start()`, etc.  These are global variables
that are "silently" mutated by the interpreter (and functions to access such
global data).

### Lua

Oil also uses a leading `=` to print expressions in the REPL.

    = 1 + 2

Lua's implementation as a pure ANSI C core without I/O was also influential.

### Haskell

Oil also uses `++` to concatenate strings and lists:

     var mystr = a ++ b    
     var mystr = "$a$b"       # very similar

     var mylist = c ++ d
     var mylist = :| @c @d |  # also converts every element to a string

Config Dialect:

- nginx configs?
- HCL? 

What about JS safe string interpolation?

- r"foo"

LATER:

- R language (probably later, need help): data frames
	- lazy evaluation like  mutate (ms = secs * 100)
- Honorable mention: Lua: reentrant interpreter.  However the use of Unix
  syscalls implies global process state.
- Lisp: symbol types

Tea Language:

Julia for signatures, default arguments, named arguments:

    func f(p1, p2=0 ; n2, n2=0) {
    }

And lazy argument lists:

    :(1+2)   # lazy expression in Julia

    mutate :(a, b)  # lazy argument list in Oil

And multi-line strings

    x = '''
    whitespace stripped
    '''

Go for type signatures:

    func add(x Int, y Int) Int {
      return x + y
    }
    # what about named return values?

and MyPy for types like List[Int], Dict[Str, Str]

(Swift and Perl 6 also capitalize all types)

Rust:

    0..n and 1..=n ?
    enum
    |x| x+1 


Clojure:

\n and \newline for character literals, but Oil uses #'n' and \n

maybe set literals with #{a b c} vs. #{a, b, c}

## Paradigms and Style

Shell is already mix of: 

- dataflow: concurrent processes and files, pipelines
  - instead of Clojure's "functions and data", we have "processes and files".
    Simple.  Functional.  Transforming file system trees is a big part of
    containers.
- imperative: the original Bourne shell added this.  
  - "functions" are really procedures; return
  - iteration constructs: while / for / break / continue
  - conditional constructs: if / case

Oil is:

- getting rid of: ksh.  Bourne shell is good; ksh is bad because it adds bad
  string operators.
  - `${x%%a}`  `${x//}`  getting rid of all this crap.  Just use functions.
  - korn shell arrays suck.  Replaced with python-like arrays
- Add Python STRUCTURED DATA.
  - the problem with PROCESSES AND FILES is that it forces serialization everywhere.
  - Structured Data in Oil
- Add **declarative** paradigm to shell.
  - Package managers like Alpine Linux, Gentoo need declarative formats.  So do
    tools like Docker and Chef.
- Language-Oriented -- internal DSLs.
