    TODO: _EmitCodeForField in asdl/gen_{cpp,python}.py does something like
    this for non-string types.  We should keep the style consistent.

    It's related to the none_guard return value of _HNodeExpr().

    The problem there is that we call i0->PrettyTree() or
    i0->AbbreviatedTree().  Although it's not actually polymorphic in C++, only
    Python, so we could handle the nullptr case.

    i.e. PrettyTree() could be a free function using static dispatch, not a
    member.  And then it can handle the nullptr case.
