  # Related:
  # - it would be nice to have ASDL value types (pass by value),
  #   e.g. val[Token] or inline[Token]
  # - we should be able to pack i8, i16, u8, u16, or even bitfields
  #   Point = (int x, int y)
  #   Point = (int[signed, 16] x, int[unsigned, 8] y)
  # It's not i16 and u8 because we recognize C++ implicit int conversions. 
  # This is storage only.
