  # hnode is our homogeneous representation

  # Cases:
  # - Full Record
  #   - product type (Point x:4 y:5)
  #   - sum type - do we need tag?
  # - Abbreviated Record
  #   - Token is <Id.Lit_Chars "a">
  #   - CompoundWord is (w <Id.Lit_Chars "a">)
  # - List
  #   [1 2 3]
  # - List subtype, with tag
  #   (Foo [1 2 3])   # uses unnamed field
  # - Dict
  #   - right now this is [Dict k:v] - change it to {k: v} I think
  #   {k v k2 v2}
  # - Dict subtype
  #   (Foo {k v k2 v2})
  #
  # Can it be more like NIL8?
  #   (Point x: 42 y: 52)
  #   [a b c]
  #   {k:v k2:v2}
  #   (CompoundWord [1 2 3])
  #   (Dict {a:1 b:2})

  # Related:
  # - it would be nice to have ASDL value types (pass by value),
  #   e.g. val[Token] or inline[Token]
  # - we should be able to pack i8, i16, u8, u16, or even bitfields
  #   Point = (int x, int y)
  #   Point = (int[signed, 16] x, int[unsigned, 8] y)
  # It's not i16 and u8 because we recognize C++ implicit int conversions. 
  # This is storage only.
