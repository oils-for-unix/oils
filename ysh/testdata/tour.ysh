# Command language

## Simple commands

### variable declaration and mutation

# Declaring a variable does NOT looks like this:
# Variable="Some string" => name=val isn't allowed when shopt 'parse_equals' is on.
# Hint: add 'env' before it, or spaces around =

# Nor like this
# Variable = "Some string" # => same error

# this is the preferred way 
# no need for capitalization like in bash
var variable = "Some string"

# also valid but not idomatic
set variable = "Another string"

# const to declare a constant
const immutable = "definitive"

# this will not work
# set immutable = "not so sure" =>  Can't modify constant 'immutable'

# mutate a variable with setvar
var new = "a brave new world"
setvar new = "perhaps it's already here"
echo $new

# setglobal will create or mutate a global variable
setglobal the_answer = 42
echo $the_answer

# there are more ways to set variable by passing them
# to procs. This will be expanded in the procs section

### Variable substitution

var regular_string = "I am just a normal string"
echo $regular_string # quotes not needed
#### if you want to do string interpolation
echo "$regular_string and $regular_string"
#### you need to do it another way if you want to substitute before a _
# this will not work "$regular_string_"
# as it will look for the regular_string_ variable
echo "${regular_string}_" # but this will

### Parameter expansion works just like in bash
var some_string = "I am some string"
echo ${some_string/another/some} # => I am another string

### Strings

# this will not work
# echo "\n" => Invalid char escape in double quoted string
# this prints the characters
echo '\n'
# use $ to print a new line
echo $'\n'

# unicode works like this
# var unicode = j"mu = \u{3bc}"
# echo $unicode

# but not like this
# var unicode = 'mu = \u{3bc}' =>  Strings with backslashes should look like r'\n', c'\n' or $'\n'

### builtins

#### echo
# takes at most 1 argument and prints to stdout
echo "Hello world!" # => Hello world!

#### write
# write outputs to stdout
# write has a -- separator to not confuse command line arguments and what you want to print
var i_am_a_string = "I'm just a string"
write -- $i_am_a_string
# if you have a string with a newline in it
var i_have_a_newline = $'it\'s true I really do \n'
# write works well with it, unlike bash's printf
write -- $i_have_a_newline
# you can print the content without the newline with -n
write -n -- $i_have_a_newline

#### test
# test has been improved to be a little less crytic

# test if something is a directory
test --dir /tmp || echo "Not a dir"
test -d /tmp # still works but less readable

# test if something is a file
test --file /tmp/maybe_a_file || echo "Not a file"

### Procs

### think of procs as a better version of bash's functions
### use proc for abstraction
proc abstract() {
  echo "I'm an abstraction"
}

### and call it without brackets
abstract

### proc can't access variables they are not given as params
### proc print_variable() {
###   echo $some_not_given_variable
### }
### print_variable
### fatal: Undefined variable 'some_not_given_variable'

proc print_variable(passed_variable) {
  echo $passed_variable
}

### call procs with arguments without brackets
var variable_to_pass = "I'm passed"
print_variable $variable_to_pass

# If you're going to use a shell function or proc in a condition, wrap it with 'try'
# to avoid a strict_errexit error
proc myproc {
  echo hi
  return 1
}

try {
  myproc
}
if (_status !== 0) {
  echo failure
}

### external commands

### Ruby like blocks

## Redirects

## Pipelines

## Control flow

### general

### use command substitution to assign the result of a command to a variable
var year = $(date -u +"%Y")
echo $year

# a failure will exit immediately
# var year = $(date --wrong-flag +"%Y") => date: illegal option -- -
# usage: date [-jnRu] [-d dst] [-r seconds] [-t west] [-v[+|-]val[ymwdHMS]] ...
#             [-f fmt date | [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]] [+format]
#   var year = $(date --wrong-flag "%Y")
#              ^~
# ./tour.sh:38: fatal: Command sub exited with status 1 (command.Simple)


### if

# if works just like you would expect

if true {
  echo "Here I am!"
} else {
  echo "I'll never be"
}

# However be careful, brackets have a special meaning
# those are for conditionals, you won't be able to 
# run functions inside those
proc is_it_true() {
  false
}
# this won't work
# if (! is_it_true) {
#   echo "could be anything really"
# }
# Syntax error in expression (near Id.Expr_Bang)
# to make it work you have to 'try' the proc
# and remove the brackets

try is_it_true
if (_status !== 0) {
  echo "could be anything really"
}

# an error in a proc will print 
proc err_today() {
  date --wrong-flag
}

try {
  err_today
  echo "will never be executed"
} 
if (_status !== 0) {
  # this will also print the proc error
  # date: illegal option -- -
  # usage: date [-jnRu] [-d dst] [-r seconds] [-t west] [-v[+|-]val[ymwdHMS]] ...
  #           [-f fmt date | [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]] [+format]
  echo "there was an error"
}

### case

### for

### while

## fork and wait

## Expression language

### Eggex

#### matching happens with eggexes, which are a different take on regex
#### you can use
#### digit => to match numbers
#### word => to match any character that is not a space
#### space => to match all the non word characters (tab, newline...)
#### dot => to match any character

var s = '123'
if (s ~ /digit+/) {
  echo 'number'
}

#### extract a submatch with < >
####   if ($(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d") ~ /< digit{4} :year> '-' <digit{2} :month>!word<digit{2} :day>/) {
if ($(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d") ~ /< digit{4} :year> '-' <digit{2} :month> '-' <digit{2} :day>/) {
  # extract a match by number
  const complete_match = _match(0)
  const group_match = _match(1)
  echo $complete_match
  echo $group_match
}
