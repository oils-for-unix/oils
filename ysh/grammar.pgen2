# Grammar for YSH.
# Adapted from the Python 3.7 expression grammar, with several changes!
# 
# TODO:
# - List comprehensions
#   - There's also chaining => and maybe implicit vectorization ==>
#   - But list comprehensions are more familiar, and they are concise
# - Generator expressions?
# - Do we need lambdas?

# Note: trailing commas are allowed:
#   {k: mydict,}
#   [mylist,]
#   mytuple,
#   f(args,)
#   func f(params,)
# 
# Kinds used:
#   VSub, Left, Right, Expr, Op, Arith, Char, Eof, Unknown

# YSH patch: removed @=

# Lambdas follow the same rules as Python:
#

# |x| x if True else 42   ==    |x| (x if True else 42)
#
# Python also had a test_nocond production like this:  We don't need it because
# we can't have multiple ifs.
# [x for x in range(3) if lambda x: x if 1]
# 
# The zero arg syntax like || 1  annoys me -- but this also works:
# func() { return 1 }
# 
# We used name_type_list rather than param_group because a default value like
# x|y (bitwise or) conflicts with the | delimiter!
#
# TODO: consider this syntax:
# fn (x) x            # expression
# fn (x) ^( echo hi ) # statement

# d = %{key1, key1: 123}
# Notes:
# - Value is optional when the key is a name, because it can be taken from the

# - We don't have:
#   - dict comprehensions.  Maybe wait until LR parsing?

# Assignment / Type Variables
#
# Several differences vs. Python:
#
# - no yield expression on RHS
# - no star expressions on either side (Python 3)    *x, y = 2, *b
# - no multiple assignments like: var x = y = 3
# - type annotation syntax is more restrictive    # a: (1+2) = 3 is OK in python
# - We're validating the lvalue here, instead of doing it in the "transformer".
#   We have the 'var' prefix which helps.

# name_type use cases:
#   var x Int, y Int = 3, 5
#   / <capture d+ as date: Int> /
#
#   for x Int, y Int
#   [x for x Int, y Int in ...]
#
#   func(x Int, y Int) - this is separate

# Optional colon because we want both

#   var x: Int = 42                             # colon looks nicer
#   proc p (; x Int, y Int; z Int) { echo hi }  # colon gets in the way of ;
