# Idea: I Want a flame graph based on determistic data!  That way you get the
# full stack trace.

# It wasn't happening in the python-flamegraph stuff for some reason.  Not sure
# why.  I think it is because I/O was exaggerated.
# 
# Interpreter hook:
#
# for thread_id, frame in sys._current_frames().items():
#   if thread_id == my_thread:
#     continue

# Note that opening file descriptors can cause bugs!  I have to open it above
# descriptor 10!

# python-flamegraph
# - suffers from measurement error due to threads.  
# - is RunCommandSub is being inflated?
#    - well actually i'm not sure.  I have to do it myself on a single thread
#    and see.
# pytracing:
# - the format is too bloated.  It can't handle abuild -h.  So I have to
# optimize it.
#
# I want to unify these two approaches: both flame graphs and function traces.
#
# Advantage: sys.setprofile() gets C function call events!
#
# Reservoir Sampling!  Get a list of all unique stacks.
#
# You can figure out the stack from the current/call/return sequence.  So you
# can use the reservoir sampling algorithm to get say 100,000 random stacks out
# of 14 M events.
