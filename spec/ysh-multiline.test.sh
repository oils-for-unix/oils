# Notes:
# - MakeParserForCommandSub() instantiates a new WordParser, so we can safely
# change state in the top-level one only
# - BoolParser is called for [[ ]] and uses the same self.w_parser.  I think
# that's OK?

# So I think we can change state in WordParser.  (Also possible in
# CommandParser but meh).
#
# self.is_multiline = False
#
# When this is flag is on, then we
#
# Id.Op_Newline -> Id.WS_Space or Id.Ignored_LineCont
#  - and then that is NOT passed to the command parser?
#  - Or you can make it Id.Ignored_Newline
#
# BUT if you get 2 of them in a row without a comment, you can change it to:
# - Id.Op_Newline?
#
# Actually this is very simple rule and maybe can be done without much
# disturbance to the code.
#
# cursor_was_newline might need more state?


#### Combine multi-line command and strings
shopt -s oil:all

var x = 'one'

# Print 3 args without separators
... write --sep '' --end '' -- 
    """
    $x
    """                         # 1. Double quoted
    '''
    two
    three
    '''                         # 2. Single quoted
    $'four\n'                   # 3. C-style with explicit newline
   | tac                        # Reverse
   | tr a-z A-Z                 # Uppercase
   ;
