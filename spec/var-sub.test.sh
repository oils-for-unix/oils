#### Filename redirect with "$@" 
# bash - ambiguous redirect -- yeah I want this error
#   - But I want it at PARSE time?  So is there a special DollarAtPart?
#     MultipleArgsPart?

# mksh - illegal file descriptor name

#### Here doc with bad "$@" delimiter
# bash - syntax error
# dash - syntax error: end of file unexpected
# mksh - runtime error: here document unclosed
#
# What I want is syntax error: bad delimiter!

# This means that "$@" should be part of the parse tree then?  Anything that
# involves more than one token.
